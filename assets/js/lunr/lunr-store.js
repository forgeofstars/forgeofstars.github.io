        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Stats   Your character’s stats are divided into two categories. Attributes represent your character’s base abilities in various areas, and are added to skill rolls. Derived statistics are other values, and are usually determined by your attributes.   Attributes     Strength (Str): How physically powerful you are. Good for feats of endurance, wrestling creatures, and attacking in melee.   Agility (Agi): How fast and nimble you are. Good for feats of acrobatics, dodging attacks, and being stealthy.   Precision (Pre): How well you can aim and react. Good for driving vehicles, firing guns, and reacting quickly to threats.   Intelligence (Int): How book-smart you are. Good for recalling information, casting magic spells, and repairing machines.   Wisdom (Wis): How much common sense you have. Good for noticing things, resisting mental manipulation, and some mystical abilities.   Charisma (Cha): How much force of personality you have. Good for persuading, deceiving, or leading other people and spirits.   Derived Statistics     Level: How strong your character is overall. Almost all characters are between level 1 and level 20, but this isn’t a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.   Proficiency bonus (Prof): How much experience you have in your areas of expertise. Your Prof equals 1 + (Level / 4), rounded up. For instance, a level 1 character has a Prof of 2, a level 7 character has a Prof of 3, and a level 14 character has a Prof of 5.   Hit Points (HP): How much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your HP is usually equal to Str + Prof + 5 * Level.   Armor Class (AC): How difficult you are to hit with attacks. Your AC is usually equal to 10 + Agility + Prof.   Initiative: How quickly you react in combat. Your initiative is usually equal to Precision + Prof.   Speed: How many feet you can move in a single action. Your speed is usually equal to 30 ft.   Skill Rolls   Whenever your character does something that has a chance of failing, the GM may ask you to make a skill roll. The GM tells you which skill to roll, which determines the bonus you add to the roll. The GM also sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the task. Some sample DCs are given in the Sample Difficulties table below.   Each skill is associated with one attribute. Your bonus for rolls with that skill is equal to your score in that attribute. If you are proficient in the skill, then you also add your proficiency bonus to rolls with that skill. Some items or abilities may add additional bonuses or penalties to your bonus.   When you make a skill roll, roll a d20 and add your bonus, and record the result. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, then your roll is a success. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC + 10, then your roll is instead a critical success. If your result is lower than the DC, then your roll is a failure. If your result is lower than the DC - 10, then your roll is instead a critical failure. These four categories are known as the levels of success. They are ordered, from worst to best, as critical failure &lt; failure &lt; success &lt; critical success. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Examples           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Saving Throws   The three skills Fortitude Save, Reflex Save, and Will Save represent your character’s ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Skill rolls made with these skills are called saves or saving throws. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following:           Result     Effect           Critical Success     You take no damage from the effect           Success     You take half the listed damage from the effect           Failure     You take the full damage listed from the effect           Critical Failure     You take double the listed damage from the effect      Attacking   Player characters are often involved in armed combat against enemies. When any character wants to make an attack, they follow the rules below.   Attack Rolls  Every weapon is associated with a particular skill, such as Melee Weapons for a laser sword or Heavy Weapons for a blaster rifle. When you attack, make a special skill roll (called an attack roll) with the skill associated with the weapon you’re attacking with. The DC for this skill roll is your target’s AC. On a failure or critical failure, your attack misses or is blocked, and has no effect on your target. On a success, your attack is a hit. On a critical success, your attack is a critical hit, and deals double damage.   Damage Rolls  When you hit an attack, you deal damage to your target. Your attack’s damage and damage type is listed in the weapon’s stat block. If you’re making a melee attack, note the attribute you added to the attack roll, and add this attribute as a bonus to the attack’s damage. If you’re making a ranged attack, do not add this attribute to the attack’s damage. Compute the total damage, and subtract this value from your target’s HP. If this reduces your target’s HP to 0, they are incapacitated.   Explosives  Attacking with an area-effect explosive weapon works differently. Instead of choosing a target creature, choose a target point (if using a grid map, this point must lie on a grid intersection). Roll the explosive’s damage, and deal that amount of damage to all creatures within the explosive’s radius. Each creature in the explosion makes a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your attack bonus (see the Saving Throws section above).",

        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. You should also grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1. Choose your General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Forge of Stars uses 6 attributes: Strength, Agility, Precision, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which generally ranges from -1 to +5. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 6. Write the final values of your attributes on your character sheet.   Step 3. Choose your Skills   You now choose what skills your character is proficient in. Skills are divided into two broad categories: combat skills, which are always used during combat, and general skills, which can be used at any time (though usually outside of combat). See Section 2 for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.   Your character is proficient in 8 skills of your choice. Write these skills on your character sheet. While you can split these 8 skills between the categories however you want, it’s recommended that you choose proficiency in at least 2 combat skills and 2 general skills.   Step 4. Choose your Powers   Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character’s powers.   Basic powers are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the Basic Powers part of Section 4.   Learned powers are tied to particular power schools and must be learned. See the second half of this document, as well as the Power Descriptions document, for a full list of all Learned powers and their descriptions.   All Learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 30 power schools in Forge of Stars. See the Power Schools page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions. See the second half of this document for detailed information on each power school.   Your character starts with 0 points in each power school. When you create your character, you split a number of points equal to your character level between the power schools. For example, if you have a level 5 character, you could choose to put 3 points in Telekinetic and 2 points in Duelist, or you could choose to put all 5 points in Battlesmith. The number of points you put into a power school is called your level in that school, and it determines how many powers you get from that school. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet.   Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. Some Learned powers are limited by your character’s level and your level in the power’s school. All Learned powers are listed as Novice, Veteran, Master, or Epic. To learn a power, you must meet the requirements in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     School Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     3           Master     11     4           Epic     17     5      For example, if you have a level 7 character, you could choose to put 5 points in the Druid school and 2 points in the Healer school. You then learn 5 powers from the Druid school, all of which can be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Healer school, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, if you have a level 9 character, you could choose to put all 9 points in the Diviner school. You then learn 9 powers from the Diviner school, all of which must be Novice or Veteran.   Step 5. Choose your Ribbons   In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to categories of power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You cannot have ribbons from a category if you have no points in any power schools in that category, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats   Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific power school.   When you get an ASI, you increase your score in an attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of 5. When you get a feat, you choose any one feat from the list of feats. See Section 2 for the full list of feats and their descriptions.   Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only difficult thing left to do is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.     Your character has a proficiency bonus (abbreviated as Prof), which you add as a bonus to skill rolls for skills you are proficient in. Just like in D&amp;D 5e, your PROF equals (Level / 4) + 1, rounded up.   Your character has a number of hit points (abbreviated as HP), which measure how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your HP is equal to Strength + Prof + 5 * Level.   Your character has an armor class (abbreviated as AC), which measures how difficult you are to hit with physical attacks. Your AC is equal to 10 + Agility + Prof. Your AC can be increased by wearing armor.   Your character has an initiative score, which measures how quick you are to react to combat. Your initiative score is equal to Precision + Prof.   Step 8. Buy Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (2000 * your character level) credits. See Section 3 for a list of weapons and armor and their prices. If you want to buy standard adventuring gear, ask your GM if you can use gear tables from D&amp;D 5e.   Step 9. Choose your Personality   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. You should write notes on your character sheet that give a general description of your character’s personality, preferably at least one sentence for each topic below. The better you act out your character’s personality, the more likely you are to get Inspiration (see Section 4).   Personality Traits. These describe the obvious character traits that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.   Ideals. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act.   Bonds. These describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.   Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.   Step 10. Write your Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.",

        "title": "Factions",
        "excerpt": "Here are some important factions in the setting.   Arcanists  The arcanists are magical researchers who use science and experiementation to try to uncover the true nature of magic. The arcanists are united by a common quest to discover the truth of the universe and to share it with others. Many arcanists hold jobs as university faculty, so that some universities have a Department of Arcana. Arcanists are also found in corporate and government research labs. Arcanist adventurers might be travelling the galaxy in search of novel phenomena or magical secrets.   Arcanist subgroups:     Kamino Institute of Biomancy   University of Coruscant   Crime Syndicates  The crime syndicates are group of loosely aligned criminal organizations. They operate outside of the influence of the Empire, controlling or terrorizing worlds across the Outer Rim. Some crime syndicates run the drug and slave trades, some smuggle goods between planets, and others pirate merchant spaceships. Syndicate adventurers could be trying to pull off ever larger heists or could be on the run from their dark pasts.   Crime syndicate subgroups:     Hutt Cartel   Ravagers   Cult Mechanicus  The Cult Mechanicus is a religious organization that worships technology. Members believe that modern technology only functions by the grace of the machine spirits, the greatest of which is a diety called the Machine God or the Omnissiah. Although most folk look down the Cult’s beliefs, everyone acknowledges their mechanical skill. Mechanicus adventurers could be mercenary engineers, or they could be trying to spread the word of their faith.   Cult Mechanicus subgroups:     Cybernetic Enhancers   Technomancers   Humanitarian Church  The Humanitarian Church believes in the inherent abilities of mankind, and in the our duty to be compassionate and charitable towards those less fortunate. Most humanitarians extend this compassion to alien races, but a xenophobic faction of the Church denies that aliens have these rights. Recently, the Empire made Humanitarianism the official religion and proclaimed the emperor as the God-Emperor of Mankind, drawing from the Church’s traditional God of Mankind. Humanitarian adventurers likely believe in charity towards all races, travelling to do as much good as they can.   Humanitarian Church subgroups:     Humanitarian Clerics   Inquisitors   Salvation Army   Imperial Military  The Imperial military works to defend the Empire from threats, both internal and external. By far the strongest military in the galaxy, the Imperial military commands fleets of giant starships, hordes of powerful tanks, and untold millions of ground soldiers. As large as they are, the galaxy is larger, and the Imperial military is constantly stretched thin guarding the hundreds of thousands of worlds in the Empire. Imperial military adventurers are probably retired veterans or defectors who reject the Empire’s authoritarianism.   Imperial military subgroups:     Imperial Guard   Space Marines   Stormtroopers   Jedi Order  The Jedi Order is a group of sages and mystics who work to promote peace and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members believe in the Jedi religion, which asserts the existence of the Force, a invisble field of energy of permeates all living things. Powerful Jedi are able to harness the Force to perform magical and martial feats. The Jedi are persecuted by the Empire due to their ties to the Rebel Alliance. Jedi adventurers probably work to promote peace and end wars throughout the galaxy.   Jedi Order subgroups:     Consulars   Guardians   Librarians  The Librarians are an order of sorcerers who safeguard hidden temples and libraries. The normally secretive monks are publicly known for their efforts to defeat and contain evil spirits rampaging through populated worlds. Rumor has it that their monastic libraries hold secrets so dark that the universe would be destroyed if they were ever brought to light. Librarian adventures might be knowledge-seekers sent to learn about the universe, or they might be protectors sent to interfere with dangerous magic rituals.   Librarian subgroups:     Grimm Hunters   Violet Nebula Sanctum   Neoshamans  Neoshamans are a diverse group of people who share the belief that the natural world is full of spirits to which we should pay respect. Some neoshamans focus on the spirits within animals and plants, while others see spirits in planets, moons, and even stars. Many neoshamans have magical abilities to manifest spirits in the world. Neoshaman adventurers could be wardens of nature, working to protect the environment from misuse.   Neoshaman subgroups:     Environmentalists   Star Shamans   Rebel Alliance  The Rebel Alliance is an alliance between several groups of anti-Empire guerillas that independently began working to overthrow the Empire. Considered terrorists by the Empire, rebels must hide in secret bases in the Outer Rim to avoid annihilation. The Rebel Alliance has perpetrated many large-scale attacks against the Imperial military, destroying starships and military bases. Rebel adventurers might be exploring the galaxy to recruit new members and overthrow Imperial oppression everywhere.   Rebel Alliance subgroups:     Republicans   Separatists   Trade Federation  The Trade Federation is a massive corporate agglomerate that controls interstellar commerce in a large sector of the galaxy. They control the entire chain of production, from resource gathering expeditions, to industrial factory-worlds, to fleets of merchant starships. The Trade Federation also maintains the galactic currency, the credit, managing interest rates and giving out loans. Trade Federation adventurers might be prospectors exploring for resource deposites or merchants carrying goods between planets.   Trade Federation subgroups:     Banking Clans   Schnitzel Dust Company",

The Empire, especially the [Imperial military](factions.html#imperial-military), is very authoritarian. The Empire believes that rule through fear is the best way to maintain public order.  The [Rebel Alliance](factions.html#rebel-alliance) is a strong supporter of democracy. They are governed by a council of rebel leaders, who represent groups of people and vote on what actions to take.  ## Chaos vs. Order  Is life best in a world where anything goes, or should everything be strictly managed and set in place?  The [crime syndicates](factions.html#crime-syndicates) embrace lives of chaos. The worlds they control are hives of scum and villainy where the daring and ambitious thrive while the common man is left behind.  The [Trade Federation](factions.html#trade-federation) exemplifies lives of order. Every part of a Federation employee's life is standardized and restricted to ensure maximum efficiency.  ## Progress vs. Tradition  Should we take risks to change the world we live in, or would it be wiser to stick to the old ways?  The [arcanists](factions.html#arcanists) believe in progressing scientific knowledge however possible. Their magical experiments tend to disregard any possible side effects on the mundane world.  The [Librarians](factions.html#librarians) uphold the traditional practice of magic. They guard against potential magical catastrophes by preventing the spread of dangerous arcane secrets.  ## Ambition vs. Harmony  Should we passionately strive towards an difficult goal, or should we accept the world as it is?  The [Humanitarian Church](factions.html#humanitarian-church) was founded to meet the ambitious goal of providing for all people. Members tend to be driven and committed to achieving the greater good.  The [Jedi Order](factions.html#jedi-order) pursues peacy and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members give up their material attachments so they can better see the spiritual connections between all things.  ## Nature vs. Technology  Should we preserve the natural world how it is, or should we improve on it through modern technology?  The [neoshamans](factions.html#neoshamans) worship the spirits of nature. They believe that harming nature means harming a spirit, an inherently evil act that should be avoided at all costs.  The [Cult Mechanicus](factions.html#cult-mechanicus) worship the machine spirits. They believe that building technological devices honors these spirits, and want to cover the galaxy in machines.",

        "title": "The Warp Drive",
        "excerpt": "This is the interstellar drive that lets people travel at faster-than-light speeds through space. It makes interplanetary travel fast and practical.  ## Physics background  Energy warps the structure of space – this is Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you have enough energy in a small space, this creates a black hole. In a black hole, space is warped so strongly that things accelerate inwards at faster-than-light speeds, which prevents even light from escaping. This gives black holes their name – they seem black because we can’t see the light from anything inside.  Physicists theorize the existence of negative energy (this is just normal energy, but you have a negative amount of it, like if you had an object that weighs -2 pounds). Negative energy warps space in the opposite direction, so instead of pulling things inwards, it pushes things away. A high enough concentration of negative energy in a small space creates a white hole. These are like black holes, but instead of pulling things inwards, they push things outwards at faster-than-light speeds.  Quantum particles exhibit a behavior called entanglement. Loosely speaking, this says that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other. For example, imagine two particles are initially at rest, then push each other away with electric force. Because of conservation of momentum, you know the two particles are moving opposite directions, but you don’t know which one is moving which direction. However, if you measure one of the particles, that tells you which way the other one is moving.  Some physicists are working on a connection between quantum entanglement and energy. They observe that in many physical systems, the high-entanglement states are the same as the low-energy states, and the low-entanglement states are the same as the high-energy states. They postulate that this connection isn’t accidental, and that entanglement determines energy. Combining this with general relativity, we see that if we can manipulate the entanglement of a state, we can warp space. In addition, if we could create a quantum state with more entanglement than the vacuum state, we might even be able to create negative energy.  ## How it works  The warp drive uses powerful magnetic fields to very precisely control the quantum states of particles at specific locations (much like a modern quantum computer). By selecting the correct magnetic resonance modes, they can manipulate quantum states outside the spaceship with minimal risk of decoherence. By creating precise interference patterns between each of the many magnetic generators, the manipulations it can do become very, very precise.  The warp drive uses this to create a very high entanglement state behind the ship and a very low entanglement state in front of the ship. This means a powerful field of negative energy behind the ship, and a powerful field of positive energy in front of the ship. These fields are strong enough and localized enough to create a white hole and a black hole respectively. These combine to distort space around the ship strongly enough to allow faster-than-light travel (this is essentially an Alcubierre drive).  While being so close to a white/black hole would normally be fatal because of the differential in the gravitational forces, the fields are shaped in such a way that the stress from one field cancels the stress from the other. Thus, warp travel feels almost as comfortable as normal travel, though slight errors in the cancellation cause slight distortions in gravity that can make inexperienced travelers nauseous.  If anything goes wrong with the field generators, everything blows up. Being so close to a white/black hole is the exact opposite of safe. If your calculations are slightly wrong, you get swallowed by a black hole. If you crash into something else, both of you get swallowed by a black hole. If you don’t account for interference from other gravitational fields, you get swallowed by a black hole. Because of these dangers, sane pilots only attempt warp travel far away from any gravitational fields that could cause interference. Usually, being in high orbit above a planet is a safe distance for warp travel.  While you’re warping, you’re going through normal space, so you can see other things and other things can see you normally. Since you’re going so fast, the stars outside seem to be moving so fast that they blur into long lines. Combat between warping ships is usually impossible, because the enemy ship is moving faster than any of your weapons can outside of the warped region. While warping, your gravitational fields don’t mess too much with anything else, as the positive and negative energy regions cancel with each other, leading to a cubic rate of decay, just like a magnetic dipole.  If things go catastrophically wrong, the white hole naturally blows itself apart, potentially warping or disintegrating nearby matter as it does. At the same time, the black hole quickly decays with a burst of Hawking radiation (its low mass and strange shape mean it’s far from being stable). Together, these effects look like a powerful explosion, almost certainly destroying the ship and likely severely damaging the surrounding area. The only lasting effects are the radiation and any damage inflicted to nearby objects – there’s no chance of the ship collapsing into a black hole.  ## Lore  Many species independently invented warp drives when they first started exploring space. Each species claims to have been the first to have created the idea, and the true original inventor has been lost to history. The technology was initially quite slow and unreliable, as the warping effect was relatively weak, and the dangers involved relatively high. Gradual improvements over tens of thousands of years have improved the stability and safety of warp drives, making them a commercial technology.  Research is continually underway to increase the powerful and maximum potential speeds of warp drives. Recent experimental prototypes have reached almost a million times the speed of light. Most commercial warp drives are weaker, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 times the speed of light, depending on the quality of the vessel and its intended application.",
