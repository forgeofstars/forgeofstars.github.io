        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended, and your recover all of your Mana. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal HP equal to half of your maximum HP (this effect can only occur once per day). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full HP, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Inspiration   The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any skill roll or damage roll that your character makes. This is a Fortune effect.   NPC Attitude   What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an attitude towards the party, which is one of the following values:      Helpful   The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn’t go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life   Friendly   The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests   Indifferent   The creature doesn’t know you, or doesn’t care about you one way or the other   Unfriendly   The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won’t agree to any of your requests   Hostile   The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way   Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.   Currency   The approximate total wealth of a character of level X should be roughly 4,000 cred * 1.5^X. Thus a level 1 character should start with approximately 6,000 cred, while a level 17 character should have approximately 4,000,000 cred worth of items.   An item generally sells for half the cost of buying the item (factoring in taxes, the item being used, retailer markups, and so on). If the item is stolen, in terrible condition, or otherwise hard to sell, it sells for roughly one tenth of the cost of buying the item.   Hacking   I’m the hackerman!",

Success         The creature loses the dying condition (but remains downed)                              Critical Failure         The creature’s dying condition increases by 1                             Aid                                      You try to help your ally with a task. The task but be something you could reasonably help with, must involve a skill roll, and must be completed before the start of your next turn. You must explain to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help, and they determine whether you can Aid your ally. Attempt a skill roll (of a type decided by the GM) against DC 20.                           Critical Success         You grant your ally a bonus to the roll equal to your Prof                       Success         You grant your ally a +1 bonus to the roll                              Critical Failure         Your ally takes a -1 penalty to the roll                             Command Minion                                                   Auditory                Concentrate                       You command a minion creature you control to immediately take two actions (minion creatures generally don’t act unless given an explicit command).                    Delay                                                       Trigger         Your turn begins                        You wait for the right moment to act. The rest of your turn doesn’t happen yet. Instead, you’re removed from the initiative order. You can return to the initative order as a  power at the end of any other creature’s turn. This permanently changes your initiative to the new position.   When you Delay, any persistent damage or other negative effects that normally occur during your turn occur immediately. Essentially, you can’t Delay to avoid negative consequences or to extend beneficial effects that would end on your turn.                    Disarm                                                   Attack                                        Requirements         You have at least one free hand, and your target is not more than one size larger than you                        You try to knock something out of an opponent’s grasp. Attempt a Brawling check against the opponent’s Reflex DC.                           Critical Success         You knock the item out of the opponent’s grasp. It falls to the ground in the opponent’s space.                       Success         You weaken your opponent’s grasp on the item. Until the start of that creature’s turn, attempts to Disarm the opponent of that item gain a +2 bonus, and the target takes a -2 penalty to Attack powers with the item or other rolls requiring a firm grasp on the item.                              Critical Failure         You lose your balance and become flat-footed until the start of your next turn                             Draw Item                                                   Manipulate                                        Trigger         Your turn begins                        You draw one item that is secured in an easily accessible location, such as a weapon in its holster or a grenade in a belt pouch. Drawing items from a pack or picking them up from the ground requires the Interact power.                    Drop Prone                                                   Move                       You fall prone.                    Escape                                                   Attack                       You attempt to escape from being grabbed, immobilized, or restrained. Choose one effect imposing any of these conditions on you. Attempt a Acrobatics, Athletics, or Brawling roll against the DC of the effect (such as the Brawling DC of a creature grabbing you, or the Spell DC of a spell effect).

You can grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or produce some similar effect. You might have to attempt a skill roll to determine if your Interact action was successful.

You can leap up to half your Speed horizontally, or up to a quarter of your Speed vertically. Jumping a greater distance requires using the Acrobatics skill.                    Point Out                                                   Auditory                Manipulate                Visual                                        Requirements         A creature you can see is hidden to one or more of your allies                        You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. The target is no longer hidden to your allies.

Choose a single  power you can use, and designate a trigger. If the trigger occurs before the start of your turn, you can use the chosen power as a reaction.   If you have MAP and your readied power is an Attack, your readied power takes the MAP you had at the end of your turn.

This might mean dropping an item, removing one hand from your weapon while continuing to hold it in another hand, releasing a rope suspending a chandelier, or performing a similar action.                    Seek                                                   Concentrate                Secret                       You scan an area for signs of creatures or objects. If precision is necessary, select a 15-foot burst within line of sight. The GM attemps a single secret Perception roll for you can compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any hidden creatures or objects in the area.                                  Success         You observe the creature or object, making it no longer hidden to you                                           Shove                                                   Attack                                        Requirements         You have at least one free hand, and your target is not more than one size larger than you                        You push an opponent away from you. Attempt a Brawling check against your opponent’s Fortitude DC.                           Critical Success         You push your opponent up to 10 feet away from you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.                       Success         You push your opponent back 5 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.                              Critical Failure         You lose your balance, fall, and land prone                             Stand                                                   Move                       You stand up from prone.

Unlike most types of movement, Step doesn’t trigger reactions that are triggered by Move actions or upon leaving or entering a square. You can’t Step into difficult terrain.                    Stride                                                   Move                       You move a distance up to your Speed.

Make an attack roll for the weapon you’re using, and compare the result to your target’s AC to determine the effect. See here for more information.                           Critical Success         As success, but you deal double damage                       Success         You deal damage according to the weapon you’re wielding                                           Sustain                                                   Concentrate                                        Requirements         You have at least one spell active with a sustained duration                        Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. If your Sustain power is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.                    Take Aim                                                   Concentrate                                        Requirements         You are wielding a ranged weapon                        The range penalty you take for attacking targets beyond your first range increment decreases to -2 for each range increment after the first (instead of -5). This applies only to the first attack you make before the end of your turn.                    Take Cover                                                                           Requirements         You are benefitting from cover or are prone                        If you are benefitting from cover, the cover’s bonus is doubled. Alternatively, if you are prone, you gain the benefits of standard cover against enemies at least 15 feet away from you. This lasts until you move from your current space, use an Attack power, become unconscious, or end this effect as a  power.

Since Talk is a  power, you can Talk as much as you want during combat, whether on your or another creature’s turn. If players try to misuse this by speaking for several minutes during a combat round, the GM should give Talk the following optional property:      Frequency   Once per round                    Trip                                                   Attack                                        Requirements         You have at least one free hand, and your target is not more than one size larger than you                        You try to knock an opponent to the ground.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Skill Rolls   Whenever you want to accomplish a task that has a possibility of failing, such as jumping across a large gap or attacking an enemy, the GM will ask you to make a skill roll. For example, you might make a Stealth roll to hide from sight, a Engineering roll to repair a spaceship, or a Survival roll to forage for food in the wild. If no skill fits the action you want to take, the GM might ask you to make a roll for an attribute instead. For example, you might make a Strength roll to hold a door closed or an Intelligence roll to solve a logic puzzle. The GM also sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the task. Some sample DCs are given in the Sample Difficulties table below.   How good you are at a task is described by your bonus to that roll. For skill rolls, your bonus is your score in the associated attribute, plus your Prof if you’re proficient in that skill. A few rolls, such as Initiative rolls, are not associated with skills or attributes, but give another stat to use as your bonus instead. Some items or abilities may add additional bonuses or penalties to this value.   When you make a skill roll, roll a d20 and add your bonus, and record the result. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, then your roll is a success. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC + 10, then your roll is instead a critical success. If your result is lower than the DC, then your roll is a failure. If your result is lower than the DC - 10, then your roll is instead a critical failure. These four categories are known as the levels of success. They are ordered, from best to worst, as critical success &gt; success &gt; failure &gt; critical failure. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Examples           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved rolls a d20 and adds their Initiative score. The character with the highest initative result takes their turn first, then the character with the second-highest initative result, and so on. Once all characters have taken their turns, the round ends, and the process repeats.   On your turn, you can take 3 actions . An action is a single thing your character does, such as moving a distance, opening a door, or making a single attack. In addition, you can take 1 reaction  per round, either on your turn or another character’s turn. You get your reaction back at the start of your turn.   Most powers have a symbol next to them that indices what actions are needed to use the power. Powers marked as  require one action. Powers marked as  require two actions, and powers marked as  require three actions. Powers marked as  require one reaction. Powers marked as  can be used at any time, either on your turn or another character’s turn. Powers not marked with any symbol are passive powers, and are not activated.   Attacking   Player characters are often involved in armed combat against enemies. When any character wants to make an attack with a weapon, they follow the rules below.   Attack Rolls  Every weapon is associated with a particular skill, such as Melee Weapons for a laser sword or Heavy Weapons for a blaster rifle. When you attack, make a special skill roll (called an attack roll) with the skill associated with the weapon you’re attacking with. The DC for this skill roll is your target’s AC. On a failure or critical failure, your attack misses or is blocked, and has no effect on your target. On a success, your attack is a hit and deals damage. On a critical success, your attack is a critical hit and deals double damage.   Damage Rolls  When you hit an attack, you deal damage to your target. Your attack’s damage and damage type are listed in the weapon’s stat block. If you’re making a melee attack, note the attribute you added to the attack roll, and add this attribute as a bonus to the attack’s damage. If you’re making a ranged attack, do not add this attribute to the attack’s damage. Compute the total damage, and subtract this value from your target’s HP.   Saving Throws   The three skills Fortitude, Reflex, and Will represent your character’s ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Skill rolls made with these skills are called saves or saving throws. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following.      Critical Success   You take no damage from the effect   Success   You take half the listed damage from the effect   Failure   You take the full damage listed from the effect   Critical Failure   You take double the listed damage from the effect   Gaining Levels   In Forge of Stars, characters level up whenever the GM feels that it is appropriate to do so. This should generally occur once for every 5 - 10 hours of real-life game time. To ensure balanced gameplay, all characters in the party should be the same level.   Leveling up an existing character is as simple as updating the character’s stats in a similar way as creating the character. Every level, you put one point into a power school of your choice, and you learn one power from that school. Every odd level, you learn a ribbon of your choice, and every even level, you get either an ASI or a feat. Your HP increases by 5. Other stats, such as your Prof or your AC, might increase as well.",

        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. You should also grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1. Choose your General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Stars have 6 attributes: Strength, Agility, Precision, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which generally ranges from -1 to +5. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 6. Write the final values of your attributes on your character sheet.   Step 3. Choose your Skills   You now choose what skills your character is proficient in. Skills are divided into three broad categories. Combat skills, which are always used during combat, represent your skill with types of weapons or magic. General skills represent your ability to perform non-combat tasks of all kinds. Lore skills represent in-depth knowledge of particular subjects. See the skills page for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.   Your character is proficient in 4 combat skills, 4 general skills, and 2 + Intelligence lore skills. Write these skills on your character sheet.   Step 4. Choose your Powers   Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character’s powers.   Basic powers are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the Basic Actions page. Learned powers are tied to particular power schools and must be learned before you can use them.   All Learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 30 power schools in Forge of Stars. See the Power Schools page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions. See the second half of this document for detailed information on each power school.   Your character starts with 0 points in each power school. When you create your character, you split a number of points equal to your character level between the power schools. For example, if you have a level 5 character, you could choose to put 3 points in Telekinetic and 2 points in Duelist, or you could choose to put all 5 points in Battlesmith. The number of points you put into a power school is called your level in that school, and it determines how many powers you get from that school. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet.   Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. Some Learned powers are limited by your character’s level and your level in the power’s school. All Learned powers are listed as Novice, Veteran, Master, or Epic. To learn a power, you must meet the requirements in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     School Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     2           Master     11     4           Epic     17     6      For example, if you have a level 7 character, you could choose to put 5 points in the Druid school and 2 points in the Healer school. You then learn 5 powers from the Druid school, all of which can be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Healer school, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, if you have a level 9 character, you could choose to put all 9 points in the Diviner school. You then learn 9 powers from the Diviner school, all of which must be Novice or Veteran.   Step 5. Choose your Ribbons   In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to categories of power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You cannot have ribbons from a category if you have no points in any power schools in that category, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats   Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific power school.   When you get an ASI, you increase your score in an attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of 5. When you get a feat, you choose any one feat from the list of feats. See Section 2 for the full list of feats and their descriptions.   Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only difficult thing left to do is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Level. Your character’s level describes your overall strength. Most characters are between levels 1 and 20, but this isn’t a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.   Prof. Your character has a proficiency bonus (abbreviated as Prof), which you add as a bonus to skill rolls for skills you are proficient in. Like D&amp;D 5e, your proficiency bonus is equal to (Level / 4) + 1, rounded up.   HP. Your hit points (abbreviated as HP) measure how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your HP is equal to Strength + Prof + 5 * Level.   AC. Your armor class (abbreviated as AC) measures how difficult you are to hit with physical attacks. Your AC is equal to 10 + Agility + Prof, though it can be increased by wearing armor.   Initiative. Your Initiative measures how quick you are to react to combat. Your Initiative is equal to Precision + Prof.   Speed. Your Speed measures how many feet you can move in a single action. Your Speed is equal to 30 ft.   Mana. Your Mana measures how many spells you can cast before running out of energy. Your Mana is equal to Wisdom + Prof.   Spell DC. Your spell difficulty class (abbreviated as Spell DC) measures how difficult your spells are to resist. Your Spell DC is equal to 10 + Prof + one of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).   Step 8. Buy Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (2000 * your character level) credits. See the weapons and armor pages for stats. More tables for standard adventuring gear, as well as strange high-tech gadgets, are on the way.   Step 9. Choose your Personality   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. You should write notes on your character sheet that give a general description of your character’s personality, preferably at least one sentence for each topic below. The better you act out your character’s personality, the more likely you are to get Inspiration.   Personality Traits. These describe the obvious character traits that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.   Ideals. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act.   Bonds. These describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.   Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.   Step 10. Write your Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.",

        "title": "Combat Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Multiple Attack Penalty   The more attacks you make beyond your first in a single turn, the less accurate you become, represented by the multiple attack penalty (MAP). Whenever you make an attack during your turn, you take a -5 penalty to your attack roll for each Attack power you’ve used so far this turn. Some weapons and abilities reduce MAPs, such as agile weapons, which reduce the penalty to -4 per attack.   Always calculate your MAP for the weapon you’re using on the attack. For example, imagine you’re wielding a chain flail in one hand and a bolter pistol (which has the agile trait) in the other. The first Strike you make during your turn has no penalty, no matter what weapon you are using. The second Strike will take a -5 penalty if you use the chain flail or a -4 penalty if you use the bolter pistol. The third Strike will take a -10 penalty if you use the chain flail or a -8 penalty if you use the bolter pistol, no matter what weapon you used for your previous Strikes.   Range Penalty   Ranged and thrown weapons each have a listed range increment, and attacks with them grow less accurate against targets farther away. If the distance to your target is less than the listed range increment, you take no penalty to the attack roll. If you’re attacking beyond that distance, you take a -5 penalty to the attack roll for each additional increment beyond the first. The Take Aim basic power reduces this penalty to -2 per range increment. You can attempt to attack up to six range increments away.   For example, the range increment of a blaster rifle is 120 feet. If you’re shooting at a target within 120 feet, you take no penalty. If your target is between 120 and 240 feet, you take a -5 penalty. If your target is 240 to 360 feet away, you take a -10 penalty, and so on, until you reach the last range increment: if your target is 600 to 720 feet away, you take a -25 penalty.   As another example, imagine you’re wielding a bowcaster sniper, which has a range increment of 250 feet, and you used the Take Aim power immediately before firing. If you’re shooting at a target within 250 feet, you take no penalty. If you target is between 250 and 500 feet, you take a -2 penalty, and so on, until you reach the last range increment: if your target is 1250 to 1500 feet away, you take a -10 penalty.   Explosives   Attacking with an area-effect explosive weapon works differently from normal attacks. Instead of choosing a target creature, choose a target point (if using a grid map, this point must lie on a grid intersection). Roll the explosive’s damage, and deal that amount of damage to all creatures within the explosive’s radius. Each creature in the explosion makes a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your attack bonus. Since the DC is based on your attack bonus, any penalty to your attack roll (including MAP and range penalties) also applies to the DC of the explosive.   Taking Cover   Having cover from enemy fire is extremely important in any gunfight. Whenever you’re behind an object, you gain a bonus to AC, Reflex saves, and Stealth rolls against enemies on the other side of the cover. The size of the bonus depends on the quality of the cover, as shown in the table before. The Take Cover action doubles this bonus.           Type     Bonus     Examples           Flimsy     +1     A lamppost, a thin sheet of metal, another creature           Standard     +2     A sturdy pillar, a parked vehicle, a plaster wall           Amazing     +4     A concrete barrier, an arrow slit, a military bunker      Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised. A surprised creature cannot use actions during the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Movement Details   If you’re using a grid during combat, one square generally corresponds to 5 feet. Because moving diagonally covers more ground, the first square of diagonal movement in a turn counts as 5 feet, the second counts as 10 feet, and further squares alternate between the two.   While you’re climbing, swimming, or crawling, your Speed is halved. Climbing a vertical surface or swimming in rough water usually requires an Athletics roll.   Difficult Terrain   Some terrain, like dense thorn bushes, uneven rocks, or slippery ice, is very difficult to move through. Your Speed is halved while you move through difficult terrain.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet per round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet you fall, up to a cap of 50d6 damage. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Health   Your HP can never go above your maximum HP, and your HP can never go below 0. While your HP is exactly 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Some effects can give you shield HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your shield HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP or temporary HP. Multiple sources of shield HP do stack. Some effects that give you shield HP also replace your AC with the shield’s AC.   Dying   When you take damage that brings your HP to 0, you gain the dying 1 condition. If this damage was from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save, you instead gain the dying 2 condition. While you have the dying condition, you are bleeding out, and you must make a death save at the start of each of your turns. Other creatures can use the Administer First Aid power to try to stabilize you.   Death Save   A death save is a Fortitude save against DC 10.      Critical Success   Your dying condition decreases by 2   Success   Your dying condition decreases by 1   Failure   Your dying condition increases by 1   Critical Failure   Your dying condition increases by 2",

        "excerpt": "Blinded  You can’t see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can’t detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception rolls that require you to be able to see. If vision is your only precise sense, you’re flat-footed, and you take a -4 penalty to Perception rolls and attack rolls.   Downed  You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You have the prone and slowed 2 conditions, and you cannot stand up. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Dying  You are bleeding out or otherwise at death’s door. The dying condition is always associated with a value from 1 to 4. If you reach dying 4, you die. At the start of each of your turns while you have this condition, you must make a death save. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Flat-footed  You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 penalty to AC.   Grabbed  You’re held in place by another creature, giving you the flat-footed and immobilized conditions.   Immobilized  You can’t use any power with the Move trait. If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against the DC of the effect holding you.   Paralyzed  Your body is frozen in place. You have the flat-footed condition and can’t use any powers. Your senses still function, but only in the areas you can perceive without moving your body.   Prone  You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. The only Move power you can use while you’re prone are Stand and Stride, and you can only move by crawling. You can Stand up to end the prone condition.   Quickened  You have more actions. You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round.   Restrained  You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the flat-footed and immobilized conditions, and you can’t use any powers with the Attack or Manipulate traits except to attempt to Escape or Force Open your bonds.   Slowed  You have fewer actions. The slowed condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by X.   Stunned  You’ve become senseless. You can’t act while stunned. The stunned condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number you regain by X, then reduce X by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned doesn’t stack with slowed.   Unconscious  You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t act. You take a -4 penalty to AC and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and flat-footed conditions. You fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding. Taking damage, being affected by a spell, or hearing a loud noise usually ends this condition.",

        "excerpt": "Here are some important factions in the setting.   Arcanists  The arcanists are magical researchers who use science and experiementation to try to uncover the true nature of magic. The arcanists are united by a common quest to discover the truth of the universe and to share it with others. Many arcanists hold jobs as university faculty, so that some universities have a Department of Arcana. Arcanists are also found in corporate and government research labs. Arcanist adventurers might be travelling the galaxy in search of novel phenomena or magical secrets.   Arcanist subgroups:     Kamino Institute of Biomancy   University of Coruscant   Crime Syndicates  The crime syndicates are group of loosely aligned criminal organizations. They operate outside of the influence of the Empire, controlling or terrorizing worlds across the Outer Rim. Some crime syndicates run the drug and slave trades, some smuggle goods between planets, and others pirate merchant spaceships. Syndicate adventurers could be trying to pull off ever larger heists or could be on the run from their dark pasts.   Crime syndicate subgroups:     Hutt Cartel   Ravagers   Cult Mechanicus  The Cult Mechanicus is a religious organization that worships technology. Members believe that modern technology only functions by the grace of the machine spirits, the greatest of which is a diety called the Machine God or the Omnissiah. Although most folk look down the Cult’s beliefs, everyone acknowledges their mechanical skill. Mechanicus adventurers could be mercenary engineers, or they could be trying to spread the word of their faith.   Cult Mechanicus subgroups:     Cybernetic Enhancers   Technomancers   Humanitarian Church  The Humanitarian Church believes in the inherent abilities of mankind, and in the our duty to be compassionate and charitable towards those less fortunate. Most humanitarians extend this compassion to alien races, but a xenophobic faction of the Church denies that aliens have these rights. Recently, the Empire made Humanitarianism the official religion and proclaimed the emperor as the God-Emperor of Mankind, drawing from the Church’s traditional God of Mankind. Humanitarian adventurers likely believe in charity towards all races, travelling to do as much good as they can.   Humanitarian Church subgroups:     Humanitarian Clerics   Inquisitors   Salvation Army   Imperial Military  The Imperial military works to defend the Empire from threats, both internal and external. By far the strongest military in the galaxy, the Imperial military commands fleets of giant starships, hordes of powerful tanks, and untold millions of ground soldiers. As large as they are, the galaxy is larger, and the Imperial military is constantly stretched thin guarding the hundreds of thousands of worlds in the Empire. Imperial military adventurers are probably retired veterans or defectors who reject the Empire’s authoritarianism.   Imperial military subgroups:     Imperial Guard   Space Marines   Stormtroopers   Jedi Order  The Jedi Order is a group of sages and mystics who work to promote peace and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members believe in the Jedi religion, which asserts the existence of the Force, a invisble field of energy of permeates all living things. Powerful Jedi are able to harness the Force to perform magical and martial feats. The Jedi are persecuted by the Empire due to their ties to the Rebel Alliance. Jedi adventurers probably work to promote peace and end wars throughout the galaxy.   Jedi Order subgroups:     Consulars   Guardians   Librarians  The Librarians are an order of sorcerers who safeguard hidden temples and libraries. The normally secretive monks are publicly known for their efforts to defeat and contain evil spirits rampaging through populated worlds. Rumor has it that their monastic libraries hold secrets so dark that the universe would be destroyed if they were ever brought to light. Librarian adventures might be knowledge-seekers sent to learn about the universe, or they might be protectors sent to interfere with dangerous magic rituals.   Librarian subgroups:     Grimm Hunters   Violet Nebula Sanctum   Neoshamans  Neoshamans are a diverse group of people who share the belief that the natural world is full of spirits to which we should pay respect. Some neoshamans focus on the spirits within animals and plants, while others see spirits in planets, moons, and even stars. Many neoshamans have magical abilities to manifest spirits in the world. Neoshaman adventurers could be wardens of nature, working to protect the environment from misuse.   Neoshaman subgroups:     Environmentalists   Star Shamans   Rebel Alliance  The Rebel Alliance is an alliance between several groups of anti-Empire guerillas that independently began working to overthrow the Empire. Considered terrorists by the Empire, rebels must hide in secret bases in the Outer Rim to avoid annihilation. The Rebel Alliance has perpetrated many large-scale attacks against the Imperial military, destroying starships and military bases. Rebel adventurers might be exploring the galaxy to recruit new members and overthrow Imperial oppression everywhere.   Rebel Alliance subgroups:     Republicans   Separatists   Trade Federation  The Trade Federation is a massive corporate agglomerate that controls interstellar commerce in a large sector of the galaxy. They control the entire chain of production, from resource gathering expeditions, to industrial factory-worlds, to fleets of merchant starships. The Trade Federation also maintains the galactic currency, the credit, managing interest rates and giving out loans. Trade Federation adventurers might be prospectors exploring for resource deposites or merchants carrying goods between planets.   Trade Federation subgroups:     Banking Clans   Schnitzel Dust Company",

        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## The Spell trait  A power with the Spell trait is called a **spell**. All spells have the Concentrate and Manipulate traits. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell.  ## Spell Properties  Most spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you run out of Mana, you can pay this cost from your HP instead; if you do, your current and maximum HP both decrease by the remaining cost. If this decreases your maximum HP to 0, you die. Your maximum HP returns to normal on an 8-hour rest.  Most spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target, it affects one creature you can see within range. If the spell lists an area, the area is centered on a point you can see within range.  ## Heightening Spells  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a maximum Mana cost of Prof + your level in the spell's school.  If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.",

        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Stars! I assume that if you're reading this, you're already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Stars, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.  ## Versatile Character Creation Forge of Stars tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Stars do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a \"power\", a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Powers are organized by theme into collections of related powers, called “power schools”. Characters are free to mix and match powers from different power schools, letting you pick the perfect combination of powers to realize your character's theme. To expand your options even further, power schools have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.  ## Tactical Combat Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Stars puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. Each character has 3 actions per turn. Planning how to spend these actions leads to tactical complexity. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.  ## Setting Forge of Stars was designed around a science fantasy world, like Warhammer 40k or Starfinder. Players can expect a setting where paladins in mechs fight against cunning cyborgs, alien wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly travel between planets to fight evil and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Stars can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a modern fantasy game only requires changing the equipment list to remove railguns, laser swords, and spaceships. Running a realistic science fiction game is as simple as banning all the \"magical\" power schools.",

        "excerpt": "These conflicts drive much of the drama in the setting.  ## Authority vs. Democracy  Do the people need a firm hand to guide them, or is it best to let them decide how to govern themselves?  The Empire, especially the [Imperial military](factions.html#imperial-military), is very authoritarian. The Empire believes that rule through fear is the best way to maintain public order.  The [Rebel Alliance](factions.html#rebel-alliance) is a strong supporter of democracy. They are governed by a council of rebel leaders, who represent groups of people and vote on what actions to take.  ## Chaos vs. Order  Is life best in a world where anything goes, or should everything be strictly managed and set in place?  The [crime syndicates](factions.html#crime-syndicates) embrace lives of chaos. The worlds they control are hives of scum and villainy where the daring and ambitious thrive while the common man is left behind.  The [Trade Federation](factions.html#trade-federation) exemplifies lives of order. Every part of a Federation employee's life is standardized and restricted to ensure maximum efficiency.  ## Progress vs. Tradition  Should we take risks to change the world we live in, or would it be wiser to stick to the old ways?  The [arcanists](factions.html#arcanists) believe in progressing scientific knowledge however possible. Their magical experiments tend to disregard any possible side effects on the mundane world.  The [Librarians](factions.html#librarians) uphold the traditional practice of magic. They guard against potential magical catastrophes by preventing the spread of dangerous arcane secrets.  ## Ambition vs. Harmony  Should we passionately strive towards an difficult goal, or should we accept the world as it is?  The [Humanitarian Church](factions.html#humanitarian-church) was founded to meet the ambitious goal of providing for all people. Members tend to be driven and committed to achieving the greater good.  The [Jedi Order](factions.html#jedi-order) pursues peacy and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members give up their material attachments so they can better see the spiritual connections between all things.  ## Nature vs. Technology  Should we preserve the natural world how it is, or should we improve on it through modern technology?  The [neoshamans](factions.html#neoshamans) worship the spirits of nature. They believe that harming nature means harming a spirit, an inherently evil act that should be avoided at all costs.  The [Cult Mechanicus](factions.html#cult-mechanicus) worship the machine spirits. They believe that building technological devices honors these spirits, and want to cover the galaxy in machines.",

        "title": "Traits",
        "excerpt": "### Acid  Effects with this trait deal acid damage.    ### Attack  A power with this trait is called an attack. An ability with this trait makes a special skill roll called an attack roll. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a Multiple Attack Penalty.    ### Auditory  Auditory effects rely on sound. An Auditory effect can only affect creatures that can hear it.    ### Cold  Effects with this trait deal cold damage.    ### Composition  Powers with this trait involve a type of performance. Depending on what kind of performance you make, the power gains the Auditory or Visual traits. You can only have one Composition power active at a time; if you use a new Composition power, the previous one ends immediately.    ### Concentrate  A power with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.    ### Daily  Once you use a power with this trait, you cannot use that power again until you complete an 8-hour rest.    ### Death  An effect with this trait kills you immediately if it reduces you to 0 HP.    ### Detection  Effects with this trait attempt to determine the presence or location of a creature or object.    ### Electricity  Effects with this trait deal electricity damage.    ### Emotion  This effect alters a creature’s emotions. Effects with this trait always have the Mental trait as well. Creatures that can’t feel emotions are immune to Emotion effects.    ### Encounter  Once you use a power with this trait, you cannot use that power again until you complete a 5-minute rest.    ### Fear  This effect evokes the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the Mental and Emotion traits as well.    ### Fire  Effects with this trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire.    ### Flourish  Powers with this trait require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 power with the Flourish trait per turn.    ### Force  Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.    ### Fortune  Effects with this trait beneficially alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one Fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple Fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a Fortune effect and a Misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.    ### Healing  An effect with this trait restores a creature’s body, typically by restoring HP, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.    ### Incapacitation  An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them. These abilities are harder to use on more powerful characters, such as player characters and powerful NPC bosses (as determined by the GM). These characters have a +10 bonus to saves, AC, or other defenses against Incapacitation effects.    ### Linguistic  An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A Linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.    ### Manipulate  You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use a power with this trait. Creatures with a suitable appendage can’t use powers with this trait.    ### Mental  An effect with this trait can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.    ### Misfortune  An effect with this trait detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one Misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple Misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a Fortune effect and Misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.    ### Move  A power with this trait involves moving from one space to another.    ### Open  These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an Open power only if you haven’t used a power with the Attack or Open trait yet this turn.    ### Polymorph  These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more than one Polymorph effect at a time, later Polymorph effects disrupt existing ones. While you are polymorphed, your gear is absorbed into you; the passive abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate or use any items.    ### Positive  Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal radiant damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.    ### Prediction  Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. They are never guaranteed to give correct results, only guesses or possible outcomes.    ### Press  Powers with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. A power with the Press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by MAP.    ### Revelation  Effects with this trait see things as they truly are.    ### Scrying  A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory information from a distance using a sensor or apparatus, rather than your own eyes and ears.    ### Secret  The GM makes the skill roll for this ability in secret.    ### Shadow  This magic involves shadows.    ### Sonic  An effect with this trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. A Sonic effect might deal sonic damage.    ### Spell  See the Spell Rules page.    ### Stance  A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using a power with the Stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you fall unconscious, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. You can be in a stance only during combat.    ### Teleportation  Effects with this trait allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.    ### Visual  An effect with this trait can affect only creatures that can see it.",

        "title": "The Warp Drive",
        "excerpt": "This is the interstellar drive that lets people travel at faster-than-light speeds through space. It makes interplanetary travel fast and practical.  ## Physics background  Energy warps the structure of space – this is Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you have enough energy in a small space, this creates a black hole. In a black hole, space is warped so strongly that things accelerate inwards at faster-than-light speeds, which prevents even light from escaping. This gives black holes their name – they seem black because we can’t see the light from anything inside.  Physicists theorize the existence of negative energy (this is just normal energy, but you have a negative amount of it, like if you had an object that weighs -2 pounds). Negative energy warps space in the opposite direction, so instead of pulling things inwards, it pushes things away. A high enough concentration of negative energy in a small space creates a white hole. These are like black holes, but instead of pulling things inwards, they push things outwards at faster-than-light speeds.  Quantum particles exhibit a behavior called entanglement. Loosely speaking, this says that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other. For example, imagine two particles are initially at rest, then push each other away with electric force. Because of conservation of momentum, you know the two particles are moving opposite directions, but you don’t know which one is moving which direction. However, if you measure one of the particles, that tells you which way the other one is moving.  Some physicists are working on a connection between quantum entanglement and energy. They observe that in many physical systems, the high-entanglement states are the same as the low-energy states, and the low-entanglement states are the same as the high-energy states. They postulate that this connection isn’t accidental, and that entanglement determines energy. Combining this with general relativity, we see that if we can manipulate the entanglement of a state, we can warp space. In addition, if we could create a quantum state with more entanglement than the vacuum state, we might even be able to create negative energy.  ## How it works  The warp drive uses powerful magnetic fields to very precisely control the quantum states of particles at specific locations (much like a modern quantum computer). By selecting the correct magnetic resonance modes, they can manipulate quantum states outside the spaceship with minimal risk of decoherence. By creating precise interference patterns between each of the many magnetic generators, the manipulations it can do become very, very precise.  The warp drive uses this to create a very high entanglement state behind the ship and a very low entanglement state in front of the ship. This means a powerful field of negative energy behind the ship, and a powerful field of positive energy in front of the ship. These fields are strong enough and localized enough to create a white hole and a black hole respectively. These combine to distort space around the ship strongly enough to allow faster-than-light travel (this is essentially an Alcubierre drive).  While being so close to a white/black hole would normally be fatal because of the differential in the gravitational forces, the fields are shaped in such a way that the stress from one field cancels the stress from the other. Thus, warp travel feels almost as comfortable as normal travel, though slight errors in the cancellation cause slight distortions in gravity that can make inexperienced travelers nauseous.  If anything goes wrong with the field generators, everything blows up. Being so close to a white/black hole is the exact opposite of safe. If your calculations are slightly wrong, you get swallowed by a black hole. If you crash into something else, both of you get swallowed by a black hole. If you don’t account for interference from other gravitational fields, you get swallowed by a black hole. Because of these dangers, sane pilots only attempt warp travel far away from any gravitational fields that could cause interference. Usually, being in high orbit above a planet is a safe distance for warp travel.  While you’re warping, you’re going through normal space, so you can see other things and other things can see you normally. Since you’re going so fast, the stars outside seem to be moving so fast that they blur into long lines. Combat between warping ships is usually impossible, because the enemy ship is moving faster than any of your weapons can outside of the warped region. While warping, your gravitational fields don’t mess too much with anything else, as the positive and negative energy regions cancel with each other, leading to a cubic rate of decay, just like a magnetic dipole.  If things go catastrophically wrong, the white hole naturally blows itself apart, potentially warping or disintegrating nearby matter as it does. At the same time, the black hole quickly decays with a burst of Hawking radiation (its low mass and strange shape mean it’s far from being stable). Together, these effects look like a powerful explosion, almost certainly destroying the ship and likely severely damaging the surrounding area. The only lasting effects are the radiation and any damage inflicted to nearby objects – there’s no chance of the ship collapsing into a black hole.  ## Lore  Many species independently invented warp drives when they first started exploring space. Each species claims to have been the first to have created the idea, and the true original inventor has been lost to history. The technology was initially quite slow and unreliable, as the warping effect was relatively weak, and the dangers involved relatively high. Gradual improvements over tens of thousands of years have improved the stability and safety of warp drives, making them a commercial technology.  Research is continually underway to increase the powerful and maximum potential speeds of warp drives. Recent experimental prototypes have reached almost a million times the speed of light. Most commercial warp drives are weaker, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 times the speed of light, depending on the quality of the vessel and its intended application.",

You gain a +1 bonus to AC, but the only Strike you can make is crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.   While in Crane Stance, you gain a +5 bonus to skill rolls made to jump.                                  Fantastic Leap                              Novice                        You launch yourself through the air at a foe. Make a Leap or attempt a High Jump or Long Jump. At the end of your jump, you can make a melee Strike, even if you’re in mid-air. You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.                                  Flurry of Blows                              Novice                                       Flourish                                 Make two melee Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your MAP to the Strikes normally.                                  Incredible Movement              Novice                        You move like the wind. Whenever you’re not wearing armor, you gain a bonus to your Speed equal to 5 feet * your Acrobat level.                                  Reactive Pursuit                              Novice                                             Trigger           An adjacent foe moves away from you, and you can reach at least one space adjacent to the foe with a Stride action                                  You keep pace with a retreating foe. You Stride, but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy.                                  Stunning Fist                              Novice                                       Incapacitation                                                      Prerequisites           Flurry of Blows                    Trigger           You target the same creature with two Strikes from your Flurry of Blows, and at least one of the Strikes hits and deals damage.                                  The focused power of your flurry threatens to overwhelm your opponent. Your target must succeed at a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Strength + Prof of be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical failure).                                  Agile Grace              Veteran                        Your graceful moves with agile weapons are beyond compare. Your multiple attack penalty with agile weapons becomes -3 for each Attack power you’ve used so far this turn (rather than -4).                                  Sleeper Hold                              Veteran                                       Attack                    Incapacitation                                                      Requirements           You have a creature grabbed or restrained                                  You pinch crucial points of your target’s nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt to Grapple the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.                                   Critical Success           The target falls unconscious for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn’t drop what it holds                             Success           The target takes a -1 penalty to Agility until the end of its next turn                                                                 Wall Run                              Veteran                        You defy gravity, traversing vertical planes as easily as the ground. Stride up to your Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. During this movement, you can run up vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. If you end the Stride off the ground, you fall after taking your next action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first. If you have Water Step or a similar ability, Wall Run lets you run along flimsy vertical surfaces, as well as vertical liquids, such as a waterfall.                                  Water Step              Veteran                        You can Stride across liquid and surfaces that don’t support your weight. This benefit only lasts during your movement. If you end your movement on a surface that can’t support you, you fall in or it collapses as normal.                                  Winding Flow                              Veteran                                             Frequency           Once per round                                  Any journey consists of more than simply reaching your destination. You use two of the following powers in any order: Stand, Step, and Stride. You can’t use the same power twice.                                  Whirlwind Strike                              Master                                       Flourish                    Open                                 You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike against each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts towards your MAP, but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.                                  Enduring Quickness              Epic                        You move as fast and as high as the wind itself. You’re permanently quickened. You can use your extra action only to Stride or Leap.                                  Swift River                              Epic                                             Trigger           Your turn ends and you have a penalty to your Speed or are immobilized or slowed                                  You flow like water, avoiding all restraints. End one penalty to your Speed, or end one immobilized or slowed condition affecting you.",

Make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically apply the effects of the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn’t trigger reactions.   This Strike has the following failure effect.                                                     Failure           The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn                                                        Mountain Stance                              Novice                                       Stance                                                      Requirements           You are unarmored and touching the ground                                  You end the stance of an implacable mountain and strike with the weight of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and have the forceful and unarmed traits.   While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or Tripped. However, you don’t add your Agility to your AC, and your Speed is reduced by 5 feet.                                  Power Attack                              Novice                                       Flourish                                 You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee Strike (which counts as two attacks when calculating your MAP). If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage.                                  Rage                              Novice                                       Concentrate                    Emotion                    Encounter                    Mental                                                      Duration           1 minute, until you can’t sense any enemies, or until you fall unconscious                                  You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain temporary HP equal to Level + Strength. While raging, you gain the following benefits:     You deal 2 additional damage with melee or thrown weapon Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.   You take a -1 penalty to AC   You can’t use Concentrate powers                                  Sudden Charge                              Novice                                       Flourish                    Open                                 With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you end your movement within reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy.                                  Swipe                              Novice                                       Flourish                                 You make a wide, arcing swing. Make a single melee Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes, each of whom must be within your melee reach and adjacent to the other. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. A Swipe counts a two attacks for MAP. If you’re using a weapon with the sweep trait, its modifier applies to all your Swipe attacks.                                  Cleave                              Veteran                                             Trigger           Your melee Strike kills a creature or knocks it unconscious, and another foe is adjacent to that creature                                  You swing clear through one foe and into another. Make a melee Strike against the second foe.                                  Come and Get Me                              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Rage                    Requirements           You are raging                                  You open yourself to attacks so you can respond in turn. Until your rage ends, you are flat-footed, and damage rolls against you gain a +2 bonus. If a creature hits you, that creature is flat-footed to you until the end of your next turn. If you hit it before the end of your next turn, you gain temporary HP equal to your Constitution, or double that on a critical hit, which last until the end of your rage.                                  Furious Focus              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Power Attack                                  You’ve learned to maintain your balance even when swinging furiously. When you make a Power Attack with a melee weapon you’re wielding in two hands, it counts as one attack toward MAP instead of two.                                  Giant's Stature                              Veteran                                       Polymorph                                                      Prerequisites           Rage                    Requirements           You are raging, and you are Medium size or smaller                                  You grow to incredible size. You become Large, increasing your reach by 5 feet and taking a -1 penalty to Agility until you stop raging. Your equipment grows with you.                                  Awesome Blow                              Master                                             Requirements           Your last action was a successful Strike                                  The weight of your swing drives your enemy back. Attempt an Athletics roll against your target’s Fortitude DC.                                   Critical Success           You gain the critical success effect of a Shove, then the critical success effect of a Trip against the target                             Success           You gain the success effect of a Shove, then the success effect of a Trip against the target                             Failure           You gain the success effect of a Shove against the target                                                        Vengeful Strike                              Master                                             Prerequisites           Come and Get Me                    Trigger           A creature within your reach succeeds or critically succeeds at an attack against you                    Requirements           You’re under the effect of Come and Get Me                                  When struck by an enemy, you respond in turn. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. This Strike doesn’t count toward MAP, and MAP doesn’t apply to this Strike.                                  Savage Critical              Epic                        The wounds you inflict are greivous.

Sly Striker              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Sneak Attack                                  Your attacks deal more damage, even against creatures that aren’t flat-footed. When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike against a creature that isn’t flat-footed, you also deal 1d6 precision damage. This applies only if you’re using a weapon you could Sneak Attack with. This damage increases to 2d6 at 14th level.

You take half damage from the triggering attack.                                  Impossible Striker              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Sly Striker                                  Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation. Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full Sneak Attack damage to a target even if the target isn’t flat-footed.                                  Master Strike                              Epic                                       Incapacitation                                                      Trigger           Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage                                  The target attempts a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Precision + Prof. It then becomes temporarily immune to your Master Strike for 1 day.

The target must attempt a Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can’t target the same creature more than once, and you must be able to see all targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target. The chain ends if any target critical succeeds at its save.

Make a spell attack. If you hit, you deal 12d10 damage, or twice as much on a critical hit. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder. An object you hit is destroyed if it would fit within a 10-foot cube, regardless of its HP, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.

Each time you Sustain the spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the same effect. You can’t target the same creature twice during a single casting of this spell, you can’t Sustain this spell multiple times per turn, and you can’t target a creature that lacks a solid form.

Each meteor deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst, then explodes, dealing 14d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 40-foot burst. A creature hit by multiple meteors takes damage only once.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10, and the fire damage increases by 2d6",

The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, but held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.

The entire image must fit within the spell’s area. The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate smells. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the Auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.

This makes it hidden from all creatures that rely on sight. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that action is completed.      Heightened (total 4 Mana)   The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if the target uses a hostile action                                  Phantom Pain                              Novice                                       Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           1 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Save           Will                    Duration           1 minute                                  Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage.

Only the spell’s target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d6 on a success, by 2d6 on a failure, and by 3d6 on a critical failure                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes 4d6 mental damage and is frightened 1                             Failure           The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2                             Critical Failure           The target is so afraid it might die. It must attempt a Fortitude save (with the Incapacitation trait); if the target fails, it dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is frightened 4.

Any creatures that would be damaged by the spell instead take only half as much damage, but the spell otherwise works as normal.

You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn’t a creature and can’t benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The range increases to 1 mile, and you don’t need to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its relative location and distance from you                                  Greater Metamagic              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.      Conservation   If you spend at least 1 Mana on the spell, one spell you cast next turn costs 1 Mana less   Overwhelming   The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage   Quickened   The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can’t use Metamagic again until you take a long rest                                  Resilient Sphere                              Veteran                                       Force                    Spell                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Duration           1 minute                                  You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.                                   Critical Success           The target disrupts the sphere’s integrity, causing it to collapse entirely                             Success           The sphere functions normally but has only 10 HP instead of 40                             Failure           The sphere has its normal effect                                                        Redirect Gravity                              Master                                       Spell                                                      Cost           7 Mana                    Range           120 feet                    Area           30-foot burst                    Duration           1 minute                                  You change the direction of gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren’t secured to the ground immediately fall towards the new direction you designate as down. Rules for falling and fall damage apply as normal. A creature partially inside the area is caught between normal and redirected gravity, and is pulled in both directions at once.                                  Reflect Spell              Master                                             Prerequisites           Counterspell                                  When you use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it’s area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.                                  Metamagic Mastery              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  Altering your spells doesn’t take any longer than casting them normally. You can use Metamagic as a Free power.                                  Time Stop                              Epic                                       Spell                                                      Cost           10 Mana                                  You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no time at all. Immediately after using this power, you take 3 turns. Rounds only pass for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable and can’t be targeted or affected by anything. Once you have finished your turns, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world.",

If you target an undead, they instead take 1d6 radiant damage and must attempt a Fortitude save; if they fail, they also take a -2 penalty to AC for 1 round.   If you spend a second action when using this ability, you also remove one Fear or one effect causing the paralyzed condition on the target, in addition to the other benefits.

Whenever you encounter your sworn foe, you must attempt to kill it if you have a reasonable chance of success. If you fail to do so, you lose the benefit of this power until you have sufficiently atoned for your actions (as determined by the GM).

The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a Sith Lord or an Angry Marine, has a -10 penalty to its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to this power for 1 minute.

When you cast this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:                  Weal       The results will be good                       Woe       The results will be bad                       Weal and Woe       The results will be a mix of good and bad                       Nothing       There won’t be particularly good or bad results           The GM secretly rolls a d4. On a 1, the result is always “nothing”. If anyone casts Augury again to ask about the same topic, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting, though if circumstances change, it’s possible to get a different result.                                  Guidance                              Novice                                             Range           30 feet                    Duration           Until the start of your next turn                                  You see briefly into the future, granting the target a +1 bonus to one skill roll they attempt before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling, after which the spell ends. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.                                  True Strike                              Novice                                       Fortune                                                      Duration           Until the end of your turn                                  A glimpse into the future ensures your next blow strikes true. The next time you make an attack, roll the attack twice and use the better result. The attack ignores any penalties to the roll.                                  Portent              Novice                        Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish an 8-hour rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any skill roll made by you or a creature you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll.   Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish an 8-hour rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

The eye can’t move, but you can see in all directions from that point as if using your normal visual senses.

Choose a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. You learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, often in the form of a rhyme or omen.

You gain a +2 bonus to Initiative rolls and you aren’t flat-footed against hidden creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following power.   Foresight       Trigger   You defend against a hostile creature or other danger    If the hostile creature or danger forces you to roll dice, you roll twice and uses the higher result, and this power gains the Fortune trait. But if the hostile creature or danger is rolling against you, that hostile creature or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this power gains the Misfortune trait.",
