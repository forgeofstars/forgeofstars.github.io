        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Skill Rolls   Whenever you want to accomplish a task that has a possibility of failing, such as jumping across a large gap or attacking an enemy, the GM will ask you to make a skill roll. For example, you might make a Stealth roll to hide from sight, a Engineering roll to repair a spaceship, or a Survival roll to forage for food in the wild. If no skill fits the action you want to take, the GM might ask you to make a roll for an attribute instead. For example, you might make a Strength roll to hold a door closed or an Intelligence roll to solve a logic puzzle. The GM also sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the task. Some sample DCs are given in the Sample Difficulties table below.   How good you are at a task is described by your bonus to that roll. For skill rolls, your bonus is your score in the associated attribute, plus your Prof if you’re proficient in that skill. A few rolls, such as Initiative rolls, are not associated with skills or attributes, but give another stat to use as your bonus instead. Some items or abilities may add additional bonuses or penalties to this value.   When you make a skill roll, roll a d20 and add your bonus, and record the result. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, then your roll is a success. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC + 10, then your roll is instead a critical success. If your result is lower than the DC, then your roll is a failure. If your result is lower than the DC - 10, then your roll is instead a critical failure. These four categories are known as the levels of success. They are ordered, from best to worst, as critical success &gt; success &gt; failure &gt; critical failure. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Examples           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved rolls a d20 and adds their Initiative score. The character with the highest initative result takes their turn first, then the character with the second-highest initative result, and so on. Once all characters have taken their turns, the round ends, and the process repeats.   On your turn, you can take 3 actions. An action is a single thing your character does, such as moving a distance, opening a door, or making a single attack. In addition, you can take 1 reaction per round, either on your turn or another character’s turn. You get your reaction back at the start of your turn.   Using a special ability usually requires using one or more actions, or one reaction, indicated in its description. Some abilities might let you do multiple things in 1 action, or others might require you use multiple actions in exchange for a stronger effect.   Attacking   Player characters are often involved in armed combat against enemies. When any character wants to make an attack with a weapon, they follow the rules below.   Attack Rolls  Every weapon is associated with a particular skill, such as Melee Weapons for a laser sword or Heavy Weapons for a blaster rifle. When you attack, make a special skill roll (called an attack roll) with the skill associated with the weapon you’re attacking with. The DC for this skill roll is your target’s AC. On a failure or critical failure, your attack misses or is blocked, and has no effect on your target. On a success, your attack is a hit and deals damage. On a critical success, your attack is a critical hit and deals double damage.   Damage Rolls  When you hit an attack, you deal damage to your target. Your attack’s damage and damage type are listed in the weapon’s stat block. If you’re making a melee attack, note the attribute you added to the attack roll, and add this attribute as a bonus to the attack’s damage. If you’re making a ranged attack, do not add this attribute to the attack’s damage. Compute the total damage, and subtract this value from your target’s HP.   Saving Throws   The three skills Fortitude, Reflex, and Will represent your character’s ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Skill rolls made with these skills are called saves or saving throws. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following.   Critical Success: You take no damage from the effect   Success: You take half the listed damage from the effect   Failure: You take the full damage listed from the effect   Critical Failure: You take double the listed damage from the effect   Inspiration   The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. A player can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any skill roll that any character makes.   Gaining Levels   In Forge of Stars, characters level up whenever the GM feels that it is appropriate to do so. This should generally occur once for every 5 - 10 hours of real-life game time. To ensure balanced gameplay, all characters in the party should be the same level.   Leveling up an existing character is as simple as updating the character’s stats in a similar way as creating the character. Every level, you put one point into a power school of your choice, and you learn one power from that school. Every odd level, you learn a ribbon of your choice, and every even level, you get either an ASI or a feat. Your HP increases by 5. Other stats, such as your Prof or your AC, might increase as well.",

        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. You should also grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1. Choose your General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Stars have 6 attributes: Strength, Agility, Precision, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which generally ranges from -1 to +5. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 6. Write the final values of your attributes on your character sheet.   Step 3. Choose your Skills   You now choose what skills your character is proficient in. Skills are divided into three broad categories. Combat skills, which are always used during combat, represent your skill with types of weapons or magic. General skills represent your ability to perform non-combat tasks of all kinds. Lore skills represent in-depth knowledge of particular subjects. See the skills page for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.   Your character is proficient in 4 combat skills, 4 general skills, and 2 + Intelligence lore skills. Write these skills on your character sheet.   Step 4. Choose your Powers   Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character’s powers.   Basic powers are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the Basic Actions page. Learned powers are tied to particular power schools and must be learned before you can use them.   All Learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 30 power schools in Forge of Stars. See the Power Schools page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions. See the second half of this document for detailed information on each power school.   Your character starts with 0 points in each power school. When you create your character, you split a number of points equal to your character level between the power schools. For example, if you have a level 5 character, you could choose to put 3 points in Telekinetic and 2 points in Duelist, or you could choose to put all 5 points in Battlesmith. The number of points you put into a power school is called your level in that school, and it determines how many powers you get from that school. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet.   Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. Some Learned powers are limited by your character’s level and your level in the power’s school. All Learned powers are listed as Novice, Veteran, Master, or Epic. To learn a power, you must meet the requirements in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     School Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     2           Master     11     4           Epic     17     6      For example, if you have a level 7 character, you could choose to put 5 points in the Druid school and 2 points in the Healer school. You then learn 5 powers from the Druid school, all of which can be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Healer school, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, if you have a level 9 character, you could choose to put all 9 points in the Diviner school. You then learn 9 powers from the Diviner school, all of which must be Novice or Veteran.   Step 5. Choose your Ribbons   In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to categories of power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You cannot have ribbons from a category if you have no points in any power schools in that category, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats   Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific power school.   When you get an ASI, you increase your score in an attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of 5. When you get a feat, you choose any one feat from the list of feats. See Section 2 for the full list of feats and their descriptions.   Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only difficult thing left to do is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Level. Your character’s level describes your overall strength. Most characters are between levels 1 and 20, but this isn’t a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.   Prof. Your character has a proficiency bonus (abbreviated as Prof), which you add as a bonus to skill rolls for skills you are proficient in. Like D&amp;D 5e, your proficiency bonus is equal to (Level / 4) + 1, rounded up.   HP. Your hit points (abbreviated as HP) measure how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your HP is equal to Strength + Prof + 5 * Level.   AC. Your armor class (abbreviated as AC) measures how difficult you are to hit with physical attacks. Your AC is equal to 10 + Agility + Prof, though it can be increased by wearing armor.   Initiative. Your Initiative measures how quick you are to react to combat. Your Initiative is equal to Precision + Prof.   Speed. Your Speed measures how many feet you can move in a single action. Your Speed is equal to 30 ft.   Mana. Your Mana measures how many spells you can cast before running out of energy. Your Mana is equal to Wisdom + Prof + 2 * (your total level in all magic schools).   Spell DC. Your spell difficulty class (abbreviated as Spell DC) measures how difficult your spells are to resist. Your Spell DC is equal to 10 + Prof + one of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).   Step 8. Buy Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (2000 * your character level) credits. See the weapons and armor pages for stats. More tables for standard adventuring gear, as well as strange high-tech gadgets, are on the way.   Step 9. Choose your Personality   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. You should write notes on your character sheet that give a general description of your character’s personality, preferably at least one sentence for each topic below. The better you act out your character’s personality, the more likely you are to get Inspiration.   Personality Traits. These describe the obvious character traits that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.   Ideals. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act.   Bonds. These describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.   Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.   Step 10. Write your Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.",

        "title": "Combat Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Multiple Attack Penalty   The more attacks you make beyond your first in a single turn, the less accurate you become, represented by the multiple attack penalty (MAP). Whenever you make an attack during your turn, you take a -5 penalty to your attack roll for each attack power you’ve used so far this turn. Some weapons and abilities reduce MAPs, such as agile weapons, which reduce the penalty to -4 per attack.   Always calculate your MAP for the weapon you’re using on the attack. For example, imagine you’re wielding a chain flail in one hand and a bolter pistol (which has the agile trait) in the other. The first Strike you make during your turn has no penalty, no matter what weapon you are using. The second Strike will take a -5 penalty if you use the chain flail or a -4 penalty if you use the bolter pistol. The third Strike will take a -10 penalty if you use the chain flail or a -8 penalty if you use the bolter pistol, no matter what weapon you used for your previous Strikes.   Range Penalty   Ranged and thrown weapons each have a listed range increment, and attacks with them grow less accurate against targets farther away. If the distance to your target is less than the listed range increment, you take no penalty to the attack roll. If you’re attacking beyond that distance, you take a -5 penalty to the attack roll for each additional increment beyond the first. The Take Aim action reduces this penalty to -2 per range increment. You can attempt to attack up to six range increments away.   For example, the range increment of a blaster rifle is 120 feet. If you’re shooting at a target within 120 feet, you take no penalty. If your target is between 120 and 240 feet, you take a -5 penalty. If your target is 240 to 360 feet away, you take a -10 penalty, and so on, until you reach the last range increment: if your target is 600 to 720 feet away, you take a -25 penalty.   Explosives   Attacking with an area-effect explosive weapon works differently from normal attacks. Instead of choosing a target creature, choose a target point (if using a grid map, this point must lie on a grid intersection). Roll the explosive’s damage, and deal that amount of damage to all creatures within the explosive’s radius. Each creature in the explosion makes a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your attack bonus. Since the DC is based on your attack bonus, any penalty to your attack roll (including MAP and range penalties) also applies to the DC of the explosive.   Taking Cover   Having cover from enemy fire is extremely important in any gunfight. Whenever you’re behind an object, you gain a bonus to AC, Reflex saves, and Stealth rolls against enemies on the other side of the cover. The size of the bonus depends on the quality of the cover, as shown in the table before. The Take Cover action doubles this bonus.           Type     Bonus     Examples           Flimsy     +1     A lamppost, a thin sheet of metal, a store countertop           Standard     +2     A sturdy pillar, a parked vehicle, a plaster wall           Amazing     +4     A concrete barrier, an arrow slit, a military bunker      Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised. A surprised creature cannot use actions during the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Movement Details   If you’re climbing, swimming, or crawling, you move at half speed. Climbing a vertical surface or swimming in rough water usually requires an Athletics roll.   Some terrain, like dense thorn bushes, uneven rocks, or slippery ice, is very difficult to move through. You move at half speed while in difficult terrain.   When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet you fall, up to a cap of 50d6 damage. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Health   Your HP can never go above your maximum HP, and your HP can never go below 0. While your HP is exactly 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Some effects can give you shield HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your shield HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP or temporary HP. Multiple sources of shield HP do stack. Some effects that give you shield HP also replace your AC with the shield’s AC.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal HP equal to half of your maximum HP (this effect can only occur once per day). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full HP, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Dying   When you take damage that brings your HP to 0, you gain the dying 1 condition. If this damage was from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save, you instead gain the dying 2 condition. While you have the dying condition, you are bleeding out, and you must make a death save at the start of each of your turns. Other creatures can use the Administer First Aid power to try to stabilize you.   Death Save   A death save is a Fortitude save against DC 10.      Critical Success   Your dying condition decreases by 2   Success   Your dying condition decreases by 1   Failure   Your dying condition increases by 1   Critical Failure   Your dying condition increases by 2",

        "title": "Conditions",
        "excerpt": "Blinded  You can’t see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can’t detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see. If vision is your only precise sense, you’re flat-footed, and you take a -4 penalty to Perception rolls and attack rolls.   Downed  You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You have the prone and slowed 2 conditions, and you cannot stand up. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Dying [X]  You are bleeding out or otherwise at death’s door. If you reach dying 4, you die. At the start of each of your turns while you have this condition, you must make a death save. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Flat-footed  You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 penalty to AC.   Grabbed  You’re held in place by another creature, giving you the flat-footed and immobilized conditions.   Immobilized  You can’t use any action with the move trait. If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against the DC of the effect holding you.   Prone  You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you’re prone are Stand and Stride, and you can only move by crawling. Standing up ends the prone condition.   Quickened  You have more actions. You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round.   Restrained  You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the flat-footed and immobilized conditions, and you can’t use any actions with the attack or manipulate traits except to attempt to Escape or Force Open your bonds.   Slowed [X]  You have fewer actions. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by X.   Stunned [X]  You’ve become senseless. You can’t act while stunned. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number you regain by X, then reduce X by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned doesn’t stack with slowed.   Unconscious  You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t act. You take a -4 penalty to AC and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and flat-footed conditions. You fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding. Taking damage, being affected by a spell, or hearing a loud noise usually ends this condition.",

        "excerpt": "Here are some important factions in the setting.   Arcanists  The arcanists are magical researchers who use science and experiementation to try to uncover the true nature of magic. The arcanists are united by a common quest to discover the truth of the universe and to share it with others. Many arcanists hold jobs as university faculty, so that some universities have a Department of Arcana. Arcanists are also found in corporate and government research labs. Arcanist adventurers might be travelling the galaxy in search of novel phenomena or magical secrets.   Arcanist subgroups:     Kamino Institute of Biomancy   University of Coruscant   Crime Syndicates  The crime syndicates are group of loosely aligned criminal organizations. They operate outside of the influence of the Empire, controlling or terrorizing worlds across the Outer Rim. Some crime syndicates run the drug and slave trades, some smuggle goods between planets, and others pirate merchant spaceships. Syndicate adventurers could be trying to pull off ever larger heists or could be on the run from their dark pasts.   Crime syndicate subgroups:     Hutt Cartel   Ravagers   Cult Mechanicus  The Cult Mechanicus is a religious organization that worships technology. Members believe that modern technology only functions by the grace of the machine spirits, the greatest of which is a diety called the Machine God or the Omnissiah. Although most folk look down the Cult’s beliefs, everyone acknowledges their mechanical skill. Mechanicus adventurers could be mercenary engineers, or they could be trying to spread the word of their faith.   Cult Mechanicus subgroups:     Cybernetic Enhancers   Technomancers   Humanitarian Church  The Humanitarian Church believes in the inherent abilities of mankind, and in the our duty to be compassionate and charitable towards those less fortunate. Most humanitarians extend this compassion to alien races, but a xenophobic faction of the Church denies that aliens have these rights. Recently, the Empire made Humanitarianism the official religion and proclaimed the emperor as the God-Emperor of Mankind, drawing from the Church’s traditional God of Mankind. Humanitarian adventurers likely believe in charity towards all races, travelling to do as much good as they can.   Humanitarian Church subgroups:     Humanitarian Clerics   Inquisitors   Salvation Army   Imperial Military  The Imperial military works to defend the Empire from threats, both internal and external. By far the strongest military in the galaxy, the Imperial military commands fleets of giant starships, hordes of powerful tanks, and untold millions of ground soldiers. As large as they are, the galaxy is larger, and the Imperial military is constantly stretched thin guarding the hundreds of thousands of worlds in the Empire. Imperial military adventurers are probably retired veterans or defectors who reject the Empire’s authoritarianism.   Imperial military subgroups:     Imperial Guard   Space Marines   Stormtroopers   Jedi Order  The Jedi Order is a group of sages and mystics who work to promote peace and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members believe in the Jedi religion, which asserts the existence of the Force, a invisble field of energy of permeates all living things. Powerful Jedi are able to harness the Force to perform magical and martial feats. The Jedi are persecuted by the Empire due to their ties to the Rebel Alliance. Jedi adventurers probably work to promote peace and end wars throughout the galaxy.   Jedi Order subgroups:     Consulars   Guardians   Librarians  The Librarians are an order of sorcerers who safeguard hidden temples and libraries. The normally secretive monks are publicly known for their efforts to defeat and contain evil spirits rampaging through populated worlds. Rumor has it that their monastic libraries hold secrets so dark that the universe would be destroyed if they were ever brought to light. Librarian adventures might be knowledge-seekers sent to learn about the universe, or they might be protectors sent to interfere with dangerous magic rituals.   Librarian subgroups:     Grimm Hunters   Violet Nebula Sanctum   Neoshamans  Neoshamans are a diverse group of people who share the belief that the natural world is full of spirits to which we should pay respect. Some neoshamans focus on the spirits within animals and plants, while others see spirits in planets, moons, and even stars. Many neoshamans have magical abilities to manifest spirits in the world. Neoshaman adventurers could be wardens of nature, working to protect the environment from misuse.   Neoshaman subgroups:     Environmentalists   Star Shamans   Rebel Alliance  The Rebel Alliance is an alliance between several groups of anti-Empire guerillas that independently began working to overthrow the Empire. Considered terrorists by the Empire, rebels must hide in secret bases in the Outer Rim to avoid annihilation. The Rebel Alliance has perpetrated many large-scale attacks against the Imperial military, destroying starships and military bases. Rebel adventurers might be exploring the galaxy to recruit new members and overthrow Imperial oppression everywhere.   Rebel Alliance subgroups:     Republicans   Separatists   Trade Federation  The Trade Federation is a massive corporate agglomerate that controls interstellar commerce in a large sector of the galaxy. They control the entire chain of production, from resource gathering expeditions, to industrial factory-worlds, to fleets of merchant starships. The Trade Federation also maintains the galactic currency, the credit, managing interest rates and giving out loans. Trade Federation adventurers might be prospectors exploring for resource deposites or merchants carrying goods between planets.

        "title": "Game System",
        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Stars! I assume that if you're reading this, you're already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Stars, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.  ## Versatile Character Creation Forge of Stars tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Stars do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a \"power\", a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Powers are organized by theme into collections of related powers, called “power schools”. Characters are free to mix and match powers from different power schools, letting you pick the perfect combination of powers to realize your character's theme. To expand your options even further, power schools have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.  ## Tactical Combat Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Stars puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. Each character has 3 actions per turn. Planning how to spend these actions leads to tactical complexity. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.  ## Setting Forge of Stars was designed around a science fantasy world, like Warhammer 40k or Starfinder. Players can expect a setting where paladins in mechs fight against cunning cyborgs, alien wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly travel between planets to fight evil and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Stars can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a modern fantasy game only requires changing the equipment list to remove railguns, laser swords, and spaceships. Running a realistic science fiction game is as simple as banning all the \"magical\" power schools.",

        "excerpt": "These conflicts drive much of the drama in the setting.  ## Authority vs. Democracy  Do the people need a firm hand to guide them, or is it best to let them decide how to govern themselves?  The Empire, especially the [Imperial military](factions.html#imperial-military), is very authoritarian. The Empire believes that rule through fear is the best way to maintain public order.  The [Rebel Alliance](factions.html#rebel-alliance) is a strong supporter of democracy. They are governed by a council of rebel leaders, who represent groups of people and vote on what actions to take.  ## Chaos vs. Order  Is life best in a world where anything goes, or should everything be strictly managed and set in place?  The [crime syndicates](factions.html#crime-syndicates) embrace lives of chaos. The worlds they control are hives of scum and villainy where the daring and ambitious thrive while the common man is left behind.  The [Trade Federation](factions.html#trade-federation) exemplifies lives of order. Every part of a Federation employee's life is standardized and restricted to ensure maximum efficiency.  ## Progress vs. Tradition  Should we take risks to change the world we live in, or would it be wiser to stick to the old ways?  The [arcanists](factions.html#arcanists) believe in progressing scientific knowledge however possible. Their magical experiments tend to disregard any possible side effects on the mundane world.  The [Librarians](factions.html#librarians) uphold the traditional practice of magic. They guard against potential magical catastrophes by preventing the spread of dangerous arcane secrets.  ## Ambition vs. Harmony  Should we passionately strive towards an difficult goal, or should we accept the world as it is?  The [Humanitarian Church](factions.html#humanitarian-church) was founded to meet the ambitious goal of providing for all people. Members tend to be driven and committed to achieving the greater good.  The [Jedi Order](factions.html#jedi-order) pursues peacy and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members give up their material attachments so they can better see the spiritual connections between all things.  ## Nature vs. Technology  Should we preserve the natural world how it is, or should we improve on it through modern technology?  The [neoshamans](factions.html#neoshamans) worship the spirits of nature. They believe that harming nature means harming a spirit, an inherently evil act that should be avoided at all costs.  The [Cult Mechanicus](factions.html#cult-mechanicus) worship the machine spirits. They believe that building technological devices honors these spirits, and want to cover the galaxy in machines.",

        "title": "The Warp Drive",
        "excerpt": "This is the interstellar drive that lets people travel at faster-than-light speeds through space. It makes interplanetary travel fast and practical.  ## Physics background  Energy warps the structure of space – this is Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you have enough energy in a small space, this creates a black hole. In a black hole, space is warped so strongly that things accelerate inwards at faster-than-light speeds, which prevents even light from escaping. This gives black holes their name – they seem black because we can’t see the light from anything inside.  Physicists theorize the existence of negative energy (this is just normal energy, but you have a negative amount of it, like if you had an object that weighs -2 pounds). Negative energy warps space in the opposite direction, so instead of pulling things inwards, it pushes things away. A high enough concentration of negative energy in a small space creates a white hole. These are like black holes, but instead of pulling things inwards, they push things outwards at faster-than-light speeds.  Quantum particles exhibit a behavior called entanglement. Loosely speaking, this says that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other. For example, imagine two particles are initially at rest, then push each other away with electric force. Because of conservation of momentum, you know the two particles are moving opposite directions, but you don’t know which one is moving which direction. However, if you measure one of the particles, that tells you which way the other one is moving.  Some physicists are working on a connection between quantum entanglement and energy. They observe that in many physical systems, the high-entanglement states are the same as the low-energy states, and the low-entanglement states are the same as the high-energy states. They postulate that this connection isn’t accidental, and that entanglement determines energy. Combining this with general relativity, we see that if we can manipulate the entanglement of a state, we can warp space. In addition, if we could create a quantum state with more entanglement than the vacuum state, we might even be able to create negative energy.  ## How it works  The warp drive uses powerful magnetic fields to very precisely control the quantum states of particles at specific locations (much like a modern quantum computer). By selecting the correct magnetic resonance modes, they can manipulate quantum states outside the spaceship with minimal risk of decoherence. By creating precise interference patterns between each of the many magnetic generators, the manipulations it can do become very, very precise.  The warp drive uses this to create a very high entanglement state behind the ship and a very low entanglement state in front of the ship. This means a powerful field of negative energy behind the ship, and a powerful field of positive energy in front of the ship. These fields are strong enough and localized enough to create a white hole and a black hole respectively. These combine to distort space around the ship strongly enough to allow faster-than-light travel (this is essentially an Alcubierre drive).  While being so close to a white/black hole would normally be fatal because of the differential in the gravitational forces, the fields are shaped in such a way that the stress from one field cancels the stress from the other. Thus, warp travel feels almost as comfortable as normal travel, though slight errors in the cancellation cause slight distortions in gravity that can make inexperienced travelers nauseous.  If anything goes wrong with the field generators, everything blows up. Being so close to a white/black hole is the exact opposite of safe. If your calculations are slightly wrong, you get swallowed by a black hole. If you crash into something else, both of you get swallowed by a black hole. If you don’t account for interference from other gravitational fields, you get swallowed by a black hole. Because of these dangers, sane pilots only attempt warp travel far away from any gravitational fields that could cause interference. Usually, being in high orbit above a planet is a safe distance for warp travel.  While you’re warping, you’re going through normal space, so you can see other things and other things can see you normally. Since you’re going so fast, the stars outside seem to be moving so fast that they blur into long lines. Combat between warping ships is usually impossible, because the enemy ship is moving faster than any of your weapons can outside of the warped region. While warping, your gravitational fields don’t mess too much with anything else, as the positive and negative energy regions cancel with each other, leading to a cubic rate of decay, just like a magnetic dipole.  If things go catastrophically wrong, the white hole naturally blows itself apart, potentially warping or disintegrating nearby matter as it does. At the same time, the black hole quickly decays with a burst of Hawking radiation (its low mass and strange shape mean it’s far from being stable). Together, these effects look like a powerful explosion, almost certainly destroying the ship and likely severely damaging the surrounding area. The only lasting effects are the radiation and any damage inflicted to nearby objects – there’s no chance of the ship collapsing into a black hole.  ## Lore  Many species independently invented warp drives when they first started exploring space. Each species claims to have been the first to have created the idea, and the true original inventor has been lost to history. The technology was initially quite slow and unreliable, as the warping effect was relatively weak, and the dangers involved relatively high. Gradual improvements over tens of thousands of years have improved the stability and safety of warp drives, making them a commercial technology.  Research is continually underway to increase the powerful and maximum potential speeds of warp drives. Recent experimental prototypes have reached almost a million times the speed of light. Most commercial warp drives are weaker, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 times the speed of light, depending on the quality of the vessel and its intended application.",

You gain a +1 bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.   While in Crane Stance, you gain a +5 bonus to skill rolls made to jump.                                  Fantastic Leap                              Novice                        You launch yourself through the air at a foe. Make a Leap or attempt a High Jump or Long Jump. At the end of your jump, you can make a melee Strike, even if you’re in mid-air. You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.                                  Flurry of Blows                              Novice                                       Flourish                                 Make two melee Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your MAP to the Strikes normally.                                  Incredible Movement              Novice                        You move like the wind. Whenever you’re not wearing armor, you gain a bonus to your Speed equal to 5 feet * your Acrobat level.                                  Reactive Pursuit                              Novice                                             Trigger           An adjacent foe moves away from you, and you can reach at least one space adjacent to the foe with a Stride action                                  You keep pace with a retreating foe. You Stride, but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy.                                  Stunning Fist                              Novice                                       Incapacitation                                                      Prerequisites           Flurry of Blows                    Trigger           You target the same creature with two Strikes from your Flurry of Blows, and at least one of the Strikes hits and deals damage.                                  The focused power of your flurry threatens to overwhelm your opponent. Your target must succeed at a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Strength + Prof of be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical failure).                                  Agile Grace              Veteran                        Your graceful moves with agile weapons are beyond compare. Your multiple attack penalty with agile weapons becomes -3 for each attack action you’ve used so far this turn (rather than -4).                                  Sleeper Hold                              Veteran                                       Attack                    Incapacitation                                                      Requirements           You have a creature grabbed or restrained                                  You pinch crucial points of your target’s nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt to Grapple the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.                                   Critical Success           The target falls unconscious for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn't drop what it holds                             Success           The target takes a -1 penalty to Agility until the end of its next turn                                                                 Wall Run                              Veteran                        You defy gravity, traversing vertical planes as easily as the ground. Stride up to your Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. During this movement, you can run up vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. If you end the Stride off the ground, you fall after taking your next action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first.

Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger is a Manipulate action, your disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward MAP, and MAP doesn’t apply to this Strike.

If the attack misses, you have deflected it. You cannot use this power to deflect usually massive ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts).                                  Dragon Stance                              Novice                                       Stance                                                      Requirements           You are unarmored                                  You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful strikes like a lashing dragon’s tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage. They have the backswing and unarmed traits.   While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of difficult terrain while Striding.                                  Dueling Parry                              Novice                                             Requirements           You are wielding a melee weapon                                  You can parry attacks against you with your weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn as long as you continue to meet the requirements.                                  Lunge                              Novice                                             Requirements           You are wielding a melee weapon                                  Extending your body to its limits, you attack an enemy that would normally be beyond your reach. Make a Strike with a melee wapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for that Strike. If the weapon has the disarm, shove, or trip trait, you can use the corresponding action instead of a Strike.                                  Bullet Snatching              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Deflect Bullet                                  You pluck missiles from the air and hurl them back at their source. When you successfully deflect an attack with Deflect Bullet, as part of that reaction, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the attacker using the projectile you deflected. This is a thrown weapon with the same range increment and effect on a hit as the triggering attack.                                  Disarming Stance                              Veteran                                       Stance                                                      Requirements           You are wielding a melee weapon                                  You adopt a fencing stance that improves your control over your weapon. While you are in this stance, you gain a +1 bonus to rolls to Disarm and a +2 bonus to your Reflex DC when defending against attempts to Disarm you.                                  Disarming Twist                              Veteran                                       Press                                                      Requirements           You are wielding a melee weapon                                  After your initial attack redirects your foe’s defenses, your follow-up wrests their weapon from their grasp. Make a melee Strike. In addition to its other effects, this Strike gains the success and critical succes effects of the Disarm action. The Strike also has the following failure effect.                                                     Failure           The target is flat-footed until the end of your current turn                                                        Dueling Riposte                              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Dueling Parry                    Trigger           A creature within your reach critically fails a Strike against you                    Requirements           You are benefiting from Dueling Parry                                  You riposte against your flailing enemy.

(You can use this ability after knowing whether the +2 bonus would turn a hit into a miss.)                                  Dueling Dance                              Master                                       Stance                                                      Prerequisites           Dueling Parry                    Requirements           You are wielding a melee weapon                                  You both attack and defend with your weapon. While you are in this stance, you constantly have the benefits of Dueling Parry.

When you use Dueling Riposte to Strike and you hit, you can move the target up to 10 feet into a space in your reach.                                  Improved Dueling Riposte              Master                                             Prerequisites           Dueling Riposte                                  Your weapon whirls and darts, striking foes whenever the opportunity presents itself. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to make a Dueling Riposte. You can use this extra reaction even if you are not benefiting from Dueling Parry.                                  Boundless Reprisals              Epic                        With a sixth sense for the flow of combat, you can quickly react to any situation as required.

Unbalancing Blow              Novice                        Interweaving your most powerful attacks in a graceful flow, you temporarily unbalance your foes. Whenever your Strike is a critical hit and deals damage, the target is flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your next turn.                                  Nimble Roll              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Nimble Dodge                                  You throw yourself into a roll to escape imminent danger. You can use Nimble Dodge before attempting a Reflex save in addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance bonus applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.   When you use Nimble Dodge and the triggering attack fails or criticalls fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains Move.                                  Sly Striker              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Sneak Attack                                  Your attacks deal more damage, even against creatures that aren’t flat-footed. When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike against a creature that isn’t flat-footed, you also deal 1d6 precision damage. This applies only if you’re using a weapon you could Sneak Attack with. This damage increases to 2d6 at 14th level.                                  Defensive Roll                              Master                                       Encounter                                                      Trigger           A physical attack would reduce you to 0 HP                                  Dropping into a roll to disperse the force of the blow, you can partially evade a lethal attack and stay conscious. You take half damage from the triggering attack.                                  Impossible Striker              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Sly Striker                                  Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation. Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full Sneak Attack damage to a target even if the target isn’t flat-footed.                                  Master Strike                              Epic                                       Incapacitation                                                      Trigger           Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage                                  The target attempts a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Precision + Prof. It then becomes temporarily immune to your Master Strike for 1 day.                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes a -2 penalty to Strength until the end of your next turn                             Failure           The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds                             Critical Failure           The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds, knocked unconscious for 2 hours, or killed (your choice)",

The chain ends if any target critical succeeds at its save.

Make a spell attack. If you hit, you deal 12d10 damage, or twice as much on a critical hit. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder. An object you hit is destroyed if it would fit within a 10-foot cube, regardless of its HP, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.

Each time you Sustain the spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the same effect. You can’t target the same creature twice during a single casting of this spell, you can’t Sustain this spell multiple times per turn, and you can’t target a creature that lacks a solid form.

Make a Sorcery roll against the Spell DC of the creature that cast the spell. If you succeed, the target spell immediately ends.                                  Illusory Disguise                              Novice                                       Spell                    Visual                                                      Cost           1 Mana                                  You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height and weight as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, but held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait   Heightened (total 3 Mana)   You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual as long as you’ve seen them before                                  Metamagic                              Novice                                       Concentrate                    Manipulate                                 You manipulate the energy of your spell, enhancing its effect. If the next action you use it to cast a spell, you modify the spell in one of the following ways.      Reach   Increase the spell’s range by 30 feet   Silent   The spell doesn’t require verbal components   Widen   If the spell’s area is a burst, increase its radius by 5 feet, or if the spell’s area is a line or cone, increase its length by 10 feet                                  Misty Step                              Novice                                       Spell                    Teleportation                                                      Cost           2 Mana                    Range           30 feet                                  You disappear in a swirl of mist, reappearing in a different location. You and any items you’re wearing or holding teleport to a clear space within range you can see.                                  Dimension Door                              Veteran                                       Spell                    Teleportation                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           120 feet                                  Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you’re wearing or holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see. If you attempt to bring another creature with you, the power fails.      Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The range increases to 1 mile, and you don’t need to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its relative location and distance from you                                  Greater Metamagic              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.      Conservation   If you spend at least 1 Mana on the spell, one spell you cast next turn costs 1 Mana less   Overwhelming   The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage   Quickened   The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can’t use Metamagic again until you take a long rest                                  Resilient Sphere                              Veteran                                       Force                    Spell                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Duration           1 minute                                  You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.                                   Critical Success           The target disrupts the sphere's integrity, causing it to collapse entirely                             Success           The sphere functions normally but has only 10 HP instead of 40                             Failure           The sphere has its normal effect                                                        Project Image                              Master                                       Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           7 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Duration           Sustained up to 1 minute                                  You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn’t a creature and can’t benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.      Heightened (total 9 Mana)   The maximum duration you can Sustan the spell increases to 10 minutes                                  Redirect Gravity                              Master                                       Spell                                                      Cost           7 Mana                    Range           120 feet                    Area           30-foot burst                    Duration           1 minute                                  You change the direction of gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren’t secured to the ground immediately fall towards the new direction you designate as down. Rules for falling and fall damage apply as normal. A creature partially inside the area is caught between normal and redirected gravity, and is pulled in both directions at once.                                  Reflect Spell              Master                                             Prerequisites           Counterspell                                  When you use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it’s area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.                                  Metamagic Mastery              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  Altering your spells doesn’t take any longer than casting them normally. You can use Metamagic as a Free power.                                  Time Stop                              Epic                                       Spell                                                      Cost           10 Mana                                  You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no time at all. Immediately after using this power, you take 3 turns. Rounds only pass for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable and can’t be targeted or affected by anything. Once you have finished your turns, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world.",
