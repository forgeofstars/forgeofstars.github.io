        <p>Following are some common rules for the game.</p>

<h2 id="skill-rolls">Skill Rolls</h2>

<p>Whenever you want to accomplish a task that has a possibility of failing, such as jumping across a large gap or attacking an enemy, the GM will ask you to make a <strong>skill roll</strong>. For example, you might make a Stealth roll to hide from sight, a Engineering roll to repair a spaceship, or a Survival roll to forage for food in the wild. If no <a href="skills.html">skill</a> fits the action you want to take, the GM might ask you to make a roll for an <a href="attributes.html">attribute</a> instead. For example, you might make a Strength roll to hold a door closed or an Intelligence roll to solve a logic puzzle. The GM also sets a <strong>Difficulty Class</strong> (DC) for the task. Some sample DCs are given in the Sample Difficulties table below.</p>

<p>How good you are at a task is described by your <strong>bonus</strong> to that roll. For skill rolls, your bonus is your score in the associated attribute, plus your <a href="character-creation.html#step-7-compute-miscellaneous-stats">Prof</a> if youâ€™re proficient in that skill. A few rolls, such as <a href="character-creation.html#step-7-compute-miscellaneous-stats">Initiative</a> rolls, are not associated with skills or attributes, but give another stat to use as your bonus instead. Some items or abilities may add additional bonuses or penalties to this value.</p>

<p>When you make a skill roll, roll a d20 and add your bonus, and record the result. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, then your roll is a <strong>success</strong>. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC + 10, then your roll is instead a <strong>critical success</strong>. If your result is lower than the DC, then your roll is a <strong>failure</strong>. If your result is lower than the DC - 10, then your roll is instead a <strong>critical failure</strong>. These four categories are known as the <strong>levels of success</strong>. They are ordered, from best to worst, as <strong>critical success &gt; success &gt; failure &gt; critical failure</strong>. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.</p>

  </tr>

<h2 id="turns-in-combat">Turns in Combat</h2>

<p>Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved rolls a d20 and adds their <a href="character-creation.html#step-7-compute-miscellaneous-stats">Initiative</a> score. The character with the highest initative result takes their turn first, then the character with the second-highest initative result, and so on. Once all characters have taken their turns, the round ends, and the process repeats.</p>

<p>On your turn, you can take 3 actions. An action is a single thing your character does, such as <a href="basic-powers.html#stride">moving a distance</a>, <a href="basic-powers.html#interact">opening a door</a>, or <a href="basic-powers.html#strike">making a single attack</a>. In addition, you can take 1 reaction per round, either on your turn or another characterâ€™s turn. You get your reaction back at the start of your turn.</p>

<p>Using a special ability usually requires using one or more actions, or one reaction, indicated in its description. Some abilities might let you do multiple things in 1 action, or others might require you use multiple actions in exchange for a stronger effect.</p>

<h2 id="attacking">Attacking</h2>

<p>Player characters are often involved in armed combat against enemies. When any character wants to make an attack with a <a href="weapons.html">weapon</a>, they follow the rules below.</p>

<h3 id="attack-rolls">Attack Rolls</h3>
<p>Every weapon is associated with a particular skill, such as Melee Weapons for a laser sword or Heavy Weapons for a blaster rifle. When you attack, make a special skill roll (called an <strong>attack roll</strong>) with the skill associated with the weapon youâ€™re attacking with. The DC for this skill roll is your targetâ€™s AC. On a failure or critical failure, your attack misses or is blocked, and has no effect on your target. On a success, your attack is a hit and deals damage. On a critical success, your attack is a critical hit and deals double damage.</p>

<h3 id="damage-rolls">Damage Rolls</h3>
<p>When you hit an attack, you deal damage to your target. Your attackâ€™s damage and damage type are listed in the weaponâ€™s stat block. If youâ€™re making a melee attack, note the attribute you added to the attack roll, and add this attribute as a bonus to the attackâ€™s damage. If youâ€™re making a ranged attack, <strong>do not</strong> add this attribute to the attackâ€™s damage. Compute the total damage, and subtract this value from your targetâ€™s HP.</p>

<h2 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h2>

<p>The three skills <a href="/fortitude.html">Fortitude</a>, <a href="/reflex.html">Reflex</a>, and <a href="/will.html">Will</a> represent your characterâ€™s ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Skill rolls made with these skills are called <strong>saves</strong> or <strong>saving throws</strong>. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You take no damage from the effect</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> You take half the listed damage from the effect</p>

<p><strong>Failure:</strong> You take the full damage listed from the effect</p>

<p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> You take double the listed damage from the effect</p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. A player can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any skill roll that any character makes.</p>

<h2 id="gaining-levels">Gaining Levels</h2>

<p>In Forge of Stars, characters level up whenever the GM feels that it is appropriate to do so. This should generally occur once for every 5 - 10 hours of real-life game time. To ensure balanced gameplay, all characters in the party should be the same level.</p>

<p>Leveling up an existing character is as simple as updating the characterâ€™s stats in a similar way as creating the character. Every level, you put one point into a power school of your choice, and you learn one power from that school. Every odd level, you learn a ribbon of your choice, and every even level, you get either an ASI or a feat. Your HP increases by 5. Other stats, such as your Prof or your AC, might increase as well.</p>
