        <p>This is the interstellar drive that lets people travel at faster-than-light speeds through space. It makes interplanetary travel fast and practical.</p>

<h2 id="physics-background">Physics background</h2>

<p>Energy warps the structure of space – this is Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you have enough energy in a small space, this creates a black hole. In a black hole, space is warped so strongly that things accelerate inwards at faster-than-light speeds, which prevents even light from escaping. This gives black holes their name – they seem black because we can’t see the light from anything inside.</p>

<p>Physicists theorize the existence of negative energy (this is just normal energy, but you have a negative amount of it, like if you had an object that weighs -2 pounds). Negative energy warps space in the opposite direction, so instead of pulling things inwards, it pushes things away. A high enough concentration of negative energy in a small space creates a white hole. These are like black holes, but instead of pulling things inwards, they push things outwards at faster-than-light speeds.</p>

<p>Quantum particles exhibit a behavior called entanglement. Loosely speaking, this says that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other. For example, imagine two particles are initially at rest, then push each other away with electric force. Because of conservation of momentum, you know the two particles are moving opposite directions, but you don’t know which one is moving which direction. However, if you measure one of the particles, that tells you which way the other one is moving.</p>

<p>Some physicists are working on a connection between quantum entanglement and energy. They observe that in many physical systems, the high-entanglement states are the same as the low-energy states, and the low-entanglement states are the same as the high-energy states. They postulate that this connection isn’t accidental, and that entanglement determines energy. Combining this with general relativity, we see that if we can manipulate the entanglement of a state, we can warp space. In addition, if we could create a quantum state with more entanglement than the vacuum state, we might even be able to create negative energy.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>The warp drive uses powerful magnetic fields to very precisely control the quantum states of particles at specific locations (much like a modern quantum computer). By selecting the correct magnetic resonance modes, they can manipulate quantum states outside the spaceship with minimal risk of decoherence. By creating precise interference patterns between each of the many magnetic generators, the manipulations it can do become very, very precise.</p>

<p>The warp drive uses this to create a very high entanglement state behind the ship and a very low entanglement state in front of the ship. This means a powerful field of negative energy behind the ship, and a powerful field of positive energy in front of the ship. These fields are strong enough and localized enough to create a white hole and a black hole respectively. These combine to distort space around the ship strongly enough to allow faster-than-light travel (this is essentially an Alcubierre drive).</p>

<p>While being so close to a white/black hole would normally be fatal because of the differential in the gravitational forces, the fields are shaped in such a way that the stress from one field cancels the stress from the other. Thus, warp travel feels almost as comfortable as normal travel, though slight errors in the cancellation cause slight distortions in gravity that can make inexperienced travelers nauseous.</p>

<p>If anything goes wrong with the field generators, everything blows up. Being so close to a white/black hole is the exact opposite of safe. If your calculations are slightly wrong, you get swallowed by a black hole. If you crash into something else, both of you get swallowed by a black hole. If you don’t account for interference from other gravitational fields, you get swallowed by a black hole. Because of these dangers, sane pilots only attempt warp travel far away from any gravitational fields that could cause interference. Usually, being in high orbit above a planet is a safe distance for warp travel.</p>

<p>While you’re warping, you’re going through normal space, so you can see other things and other things can see you normally. Since you’re going so fast, the stars outside seem to be moving so fast that they blur into long lines. Combat between warping ships is usually impossible, because the enemy ship is moving faster than any of your weapons can outside of the warped region. While warping, your gravitational fields don’t mess too much with anything else, as the positive and negative energy regions cancel with each other, leading to a cubic rate of decay, just like a magnetic dipole.</p>

<p>If things go catastrophically wrong, the white hole naturally blows itself apart, potentially warping or disintegrating nearby matter as it does. At the same time, the black hole quickly decays with a burst of Hawking radiation (its low mass and strange shape mean it’s far from being stable). Together, these effects look like a powerful explosion, almost certainly destroying the ship and likely severely damaging the surrounding area. The only lasting effects are the radiation and any damage inflicted to nearby objects – there’s no chance of the ship collapsing into a black hole.</p>

<h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>

<p>Many species independently invented warp drives when they first started exploring space. Each species claims to have been the first to have created the idea, and the true original inventor has been lost to history. The technology was initially quite slow and unreliable, as the warping effect was relatively weak, and the dangers involved relatively high. Gradual improvements over tens of thousands of years have improved the stability and safety of warp drives, making them a commercial technology.</p>

<p>Research is continually underway to increase the powerful and maximum potential speeds of warp drives. Recent experimental prototypes have reached almost a million times the speed of light. Most commercial warp drives are weaker, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 times the speed of light, depending on the quality of the vessel and its intended application.</p>
